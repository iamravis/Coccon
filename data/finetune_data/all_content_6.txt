**It's important to understand your birth options if you're expecting more than 1 baby.**

Twins and triplets are more likely to be [born early](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/premature-labour-and-birth/) and need [special care](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/after-the-birth/special-care-ill-or-premature-babies/) after birth than single babies.

Your birth choices with twins
-----------------------------

It's a good idea to discuss your birth options with your midwife or consultant early on in your pregnancy.

You'll normally be advised to give birth in a hospital, as there's a higher chance of complications with twins.

There are usually more health professionals at a multiple birth – for example, there may be 2 midwives, an obstetrician and 2 paediatricians (1 for each baby).

For more information on who's who, [read about the antenatal team](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/antenatal-support-meet-the-team/).

The process of labour is more or less the same as for 1 baby, but your maternity team will usually advise you to have your babies electronically monitored because of the higher risk of complications.

This means attaching belts with sensors (1 for each twin) to your bump. You'll still be able to move around into different positions.

Once your waters have broken, your midwife may ask your permission to attach a clip attached to a wire to the first baby's head to get a more accurate measure of their heartbeat.

You'll be offered a drip in case it's needed later – for example, to restart contractions after your first baby is born.

Triplets or more babies are almost always delivered by a planned [caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/).

Can you have a natural birth with twins?
----------------------------------------

Lots of women think they have to have a caesarean section with twins, but in fact, many twin births are vaginal

If you're planning a vaginal delivery, it's usually recommended that you have an [epidural](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidural/) for pain relief, but you can discuss this with your midwife.

If there are any problems, it's easier for your antenatal team to deliver your babies quickly if you have already got an epidural in place.

[Find out more about the signs and stages of labour](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/the-stages-of-labour-and-birth/)

You're more likely to have a vaginal birth if the first twin is in a head-down position.

But there may be medical reasons why a vaginal birth is not recommended.

If you have had a caesarean section before, for example, it's not usually recommended that you have a vaginal birth with twins.

As with any vaginal birth, you may need an assisted birth. This is where [forceps or vacuum delivery](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/forceps-or-vacuum-delivery/) are used to help deliver your babies.

Once the first baby is born, your midwife or doctor can check the position of the second baby by feeling your tummy and doing a vaginal examination. They may also use an ultrasound scan.

If the second baby is in a good position, it should be born soon after the first, as your cervix is already fully dilated.

If your contractions stop after the first baby is born, the doctor or midwife may discuss giving you hormones via a drip to restart them.

Caesarean section and twins
---------------------------

In the UK, more than half of twins and almost all triplets are delivered by caesarean section is a common method used during twin and triplet births.

You may choose to have a planned caesarean, or your doctor may recommend a caesarean, if:

*   the first baby is lying feet, knees or buttocks first (breech)
*   1 twin is lying sideways (transverse)
*   you have a low-lying placenta
*   your twins share a placenta
*   you have had a difficult delivery with a single baby before

As with any pregnancy, if you plan a vaginal birth, you may still end up needing an emergency caesarean.

In a small number of cases, some women deliver 1 twin vaginally and then need a caesarean section to deliver the second twin.

Your pain relief options
------------------------

Labour can be painful – it can help to learn about all the ways you can relieve the pain.

It's also helpful for whoever is going to be with you during your labour to know about the different options, as well as how they can support you.

Ask your midwife or doctor to explain what's available so you can decide what's best for you.

Write down your wishes in your birth plan, but remember you need to keep an open mind. You may find you want more pain relief than you'd planned, or your doctor or midwife may suggest more effective pain relief to help the delivery.

Self-help in labour
-------------------

You're likely to feel more relaxed in labour and better placed to cope with the pain if you:

*   [learn about labour](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/signs-that-labour-has-begun/) – this can make you feel more in control and less frightened about what's going to happen; talk to your midwife or doctor, ask them questions, and go to [antenatal classes](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/antenatal-classes/)
*   learn how to relax, stay calm and breathe deeply
*   keep moving – your position can make a difference, so try kneeling, walking around, or rocking backwards and forwards
*   bring a partner, friend or relative to support you during labour, but do not worry if you do not have a partner – your midwife will give you all the support you need
*   ask your partner to massage you – although you may find you do not want to be touched
*   have a bath
*   take paracetamol, which can help relieve some of the pain in the early stages of labour

Gas and air (Entonox) for labour
--------------------------------

This is a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide gas. Gas and air will not remove all the pain, but it can help reduce it and make it more bearable. It's easy to use and you control it yourself.

You breathe in the gas and air through a mask or mouthpiece, which you hold yourself. The gas takes about 15 to 20 seconds to work, so you breathe it in just as a contraction begins. It works best if you take slow, deep breaths.

### Side effects

*   there are no harmful side effects for you or the baby
*   it can make you feel lightheaded, sick, sleepy or unable to concentrate, but if this happens you can stop using it

If gas and air does not give you enough pain relief, you can ask for a painkilling injection as well.

Pethidine injections in labour
------------------------------

This is an injection of a medicine called pethidine into your thigh or buttock to relieve pain. It can also help you to relax. Sometimes, less commonly, a medicine called diamorphine is used.

It takes about 20 minutes to work after the injection. The effects last between 2 and 4 hours, so would not be recommended if you're getting close to the pushing (second) stage of labour.

### Side effects

There are some side effects of pethidine and diamorphine to be aware of:

*   it can make you feel woozy, sick and forgetful
*   if pethidine or diamorphine are given too close to the time of delivery, they may affect the baby's breathing – if this happens, another medicine to reverse the effect will be given
*   these medicines can interfere with the baby's first feed

Epidural
--------

An [epidural](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidural/) is a type of [local anaesthetic](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/local-anaesthesia/). It numbs the nerves that carry the pain impulses from the birth canal to the brain. It should not make you sick or drowsy.

In most cases, an epidural gives complete pain relief. It can be helpful if you are having a long or particularly painful labour.

An anaesthetist is the only person who can give an epidural, so it will not be available at home. If you think you might want one, check whether anaesthetists are always available at your hospital.

How much you can move your legs after an epidural depends on the local anaesthetic used. Some hospitals offer "mobile" epidurals, which means you can walk around.

However, this also requires the baby's heart rate to be monitored remotely (by telemetry) and many hospitals do not have the equipment to do this. Ask your midwife if mobile epidural is available in your local hospital.

An epidural can provide very good pain relief, but it's not always completely effective in labour.

### How does an epidural work?

To have an epidural:

*   a drip will run fluid through a needle into a vein in your arm
*   while you lie on your side or sit up in a curled position, an anaesthetist will clean your back with antiseptic, numb a small area with some local anaesthetic, and then introduce a needle into your back
*   a very thin tube will be passed through the needle into your back near the nerves that carry pain impulses from the womb (uterus). Medicines (usually a mixture of local anaesthetic and opioid) are administered through this tube. It takes about 10 minutes to set up the epidural, and another 10 to15 minutes for it to work. It does not always work perfectly at first and may need adjusting
*   the epidural can be topped up by your midwife, or you may be able to top it up yourself through a machine
*   your contractions and the baby's heart rate will need to be continuously monitored. This means having a belt around your abdomen and possibly a clip attached to the baby's head

### Side effects of epidurals in labour

There are some side effects of epidurals to be aware of.

An epidural may make your legs feel heavy, depending on the local anaesthetic used.

Your blood pressure can drop (hypotension), but this is rare because the fluid given through the drip in your arm helps to maintain good blood pressure.

Epidurals can prolong the second stage of labour. If you can no longer feel your contractions, the midwife will have to tell you when to push. This means that forceps or a ventouse may be needed to help deliver the baby [(instrumental delivery)](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/forceps-or-vacuum-delivery/).

When you have an epidural, your midwife or doctor will wait longer for the baby's head to come down (before you start pushing), as long as the baby is showing no signs of distress. This reduces the chance you'll need an instrumental delivery. Sometimes less anaesthetic is given towards the end, so the effect wears off and you can feel to push the baby out naturally.

You may find it difficult to pee as a result of the epidural. If so, a small tube called a catheter may be put into your bladder to help you.

You may get a headache after an epidural. This happens in about 1 in 100 cases and can be treated.

Your back might be a bit sore for a day or two, but epidurals do not cause long-term backache.

You may feel tingles or pins and needles down one leg after having a baby. This happens in about 1 in 2,000 cases. This is more likely to be the result of childbirth itself rather than the epidural. You'll be advised by the doctor or midwife when you can get out of bed.

Remifentanil
------------

Remifentanil goes into a vein in your arm. You control it yourself by pushing a button.

It works quickly and wears off after a few minutes. You can use it up until your baby is born.

You’ll need a small clip on your finger to measure your oxygen levels, as remifentanil can make you feel breathless or need oxygen.

### Side effects

Remifentanil can make you feel sleepy, sick, dizzy or itchy. These stop once you stop taking the medicine.

Like pethidine, remifentanil can affect the baby’s breathing but this usually wears off quickly.

Using water in labour (water birth)
-----------------------------------

Being in water can help you relax and make the contractions seem less painful. Ask if you can have a bath or use a birth pool. The water will be kept at a comfortable temperature, but not above 37.5C, and your temperature will be monitored.

[Find out more about using water during labour and birth on the National Childbirth Trust website](https://www.nct.org.uk/labour-birth/different-types-birth/water-birth/how-labour-water-or-have-water-birth)

TENS machines
-------------

TENS stands for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Some hospitals have TENS machines. If not, you can hire your own machine.

TENS has not been shown to be effective during the active phase of labour, when contractions get longer, stronger and more frequent. It's probably most effective during the early stages, when you may have lower back pain.

TENS may also be useful while you're at home in the early stages of labour or if you plan to give birth at home. If you're interested in TENS, learn how to use it in the later months of your pregnancy. Ask your midwife to show you how it works.

### How TENS machines work

Electrodes are taped on to your back and connected by wires to a small battery-powered stimulator. Holding this, you give yourself small, safe amounts of current through the electrodes. You can move around while you use TENS.

TENS is believed to work by stimulating the body to produce more of its own natural painkillers, called endorphins. It also reduces the number of pain signals sent to the brain by the spinal cord.

### Side effects of TENS machines

There are no known side effects of TENS for either you or the baby.

Alternative methods of labour pain relief
-----------------------------------------

You may choose alternative treatments such as acupuncture, aromatherapy, homeopathy, hypnosis, massage and reflexology. Most of these techniques are not proven to provide effective pain relief.

If you'd like to use any of these methods, it's important to discuss them with your midwife or doctor and let the hospital know beforehand. Most hospitals do not offer them for pain relief during labour.

If you want to try any of these techniques, make sure the practitioner is properly trained and experienced.

Title: Episiotomy and perineal tears

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/episiotomy-and-perineal-tears/

Published Time: 2 Dec 2020, 2:12 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Sometimes a doctor or midwife may need to make a cut in the area between the vagina and anus (perineum) during childbirth. This is called an episiotomy.

An episiotomy makes the opening of the vagina a bit wider, allowing the baby to come through it more easily.

Sometimes a woman's perineum may tear as their baby comes out. In some births, an episiotomy can help to prevent a severe tear or speed up delivery if the baby needs to be born quickly.

If your doctor or midwife feels you need an episiotomy when you're in labour, they will discuss this with you. In England, episiotomies are not done routinely.

Up to 9 in 10 first-time mothers who have a vaginal birth will have some sort of tear, graze or episiotomy.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that an episiotomy might be done if:

*   the baby is in distress and needs to be born quickly, or
*   there is a need for [forceps or vacuum delivery (ventouse)](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/forceps-or-vacuum-delivery/), or
*   there is a risk of a tear to the anus

If you have a tear or an episiotomy, you'll probably need stitches to repair it. Dissolvable stitches are used, so you will not need to return to hospital to have them removed.

Non-urgent advice: Call your midwife or GP if you've had an episiotomy or tear and:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   your stitches get more painful
*   there's smelly discharge
*   there's red, swollen skin around the cut (incision) or tear – you can use a mirror to have a look

Any of these may mean you have an infection.

Why you might need an episiotomy
--------------------------------

An episiotomy may be recommended if your baby develops a condition known as foetal distress, where the baby's heart rate gets faster or slower before birth.

This means your baby may not be getting enough oxygen and has to be delivered quickly to avoid the risk of birth injuries or [stillbirth](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stillbirth/).

Another reason for an episiotomy is because it's necessary to widen your vagina so instruments, such as forceps or ventouse suction, can be used to help with the birth.

This may be necessary if:

*   you're having a [breech birth](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/if-your-baby-is-breech/), where the baby is being born with their bottom or feet first
*   you have been trying to give birth for several hours and are now tired after pushing
*   you have a serious health condition, such as [heart disease](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/existing-health-conditions/coronary-heart-disease/) and it's recommended that delivery should be as quick as possible to reduce further health risks

Research shows that in some births, particularly with forceps deliveries, an episiotomy may prevent tears that affect the anal muscle (third-degree tears).

How an episiotomy is done
-------------------------

An episiotomy is usually a simple procedure. A [local anaesthetic](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/local-anaesthesia/) is used to numb the area around the vagina so you do not feel any pain. If you have already had an epidural, the dose can be topped up before the cut is made.

Whenever possible, the doctor or midwife will make a small diagonal cut from the back of the vagina, directed down and out to one side. The cut is stitched together using dissolvable stitches after the birth.

Recovering from an episiotomy
-----------------------------

Episiotomy cuts are usually repaired within an hour of your baby's birth. The cut may bleed quite a lot at first, but this should stop with pressure and stitches.

Stitches should heal within 1 month of the birth. Talk to your midwife or obstetrician about which activities you should avoid during the healing period.

### Coping with pain

It's common to feel some pain after an episiotomy.

Painkillers such as [paracetamol](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/paracetamol-for-adults/) can help relieve pain and is safe to use if you're breastfeeding.

It's also thought to be safe to take ibuprofen while you're breastfeeding, but check with your doctor first.

Aspirin is not recommended as it can be passed on to your baby through your breast milk. Your midwife will advise you if you're not sure what painkillers to take.

It may be necessary to treat severe pain with stronger prescription-only painkillers, such as codeine.

However, prescription-only medicine may affect your ability to breastfeed safely. Your GP or midwife can advise you about this.

To ease the pain, try placing an ice pack or ice cubes wrapped in a towel on the cut. Avoid placing ice directly on your skin as this could cause damage.

Exposing the stitches to fresh air can help the healing process. Taking off your underwear and lying on a towel on your bed for around 10 minutes once or twice a day may help.

It's unusual for pain after an episiotomy to last longer than 2 to 3 weeks. If the pain lasts longer than this, speak to a doctor, health visitor, or another health professional.

### Going to the toilet

Keep the cut and the surrounding area clean to prevent infection. After going to the toilet, pour warm water over your vaginal area to rinse it.

Pouring warm water over the outer area of your vagina as you pee may also help ease the discomfort.

You may find squatting over the toilet, rather than sitting on it, reduces the stinging sensation when peeing.

When you're pooing, you may find it useful to place a clean pad on the cut and press gently. This can help relieve pressure on the cut.

When wiping your bottom, make sure you wipe gently from front to back. This will help prevent bacteria in your anus infecting the cut and surrounding tissue.

If you find pooing is particularly painful, taking [laxatives](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/laxatives/) may help. This type of medicine is usually used to treat constipation and makes poo softer and easier to pass.

For more information, read about treating [constipation](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/constipation/).

### Pain during sex

There are no rules about when to start having sex again after you've given birth.

In the weeks after giving birth, many women feel sore as well as tired, whether they've had an episiotomy or not. Do not rush into it. If sex hurts, it will not be pleasurable.

If you've had a tear or an episiotomy, pain during sex is very common in the first few months.

If penetration is painful, say so. If you pretend everything is OK when it is not, you may start to see sex as a nuisance rather than a pleasure, which will not help you or your partner.

You can still be close without having penetration – for example, through mutual masturbation.

Pain can sometimes be linked to vaginal dryness. You can try using a water-based lubricant available from pharmacies to help.

Do not use an oil-based lubricant, such as Vaseline or moisturising lotion, as this can irritate the vagina and damage latex [condoms](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/male-condoms/) or [diaphragms](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/contraceptive-diaphragm-or-cap/).

You can get pregnant just 3 weeks after the birth of a baby, even if you're breastfeeding and your periods have not started again.

Use some kind of [contraception](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/) every time you have sex after giving birth, including the first time (unless you want to get pregnant again).

You'll usually have an opportunity to discuss your contraceptive options before you leave hospital (if you've had your baby in hospital) and at the postnatal check.

You can also talk to a GP, midwife or health visitor, or go to a contraception clinic at any time.

Find [sexual health services near you](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/sexual-health/find-a-sexual-health-clinic).

### Infection

Look out for any signs that the cut or surrounding tissue has become infected, such as:

*   red, swollen skin
*   discharge of pus or liquid from the cut
*   persistent pain
*   an unusual smell

Tell a GP, midwife or health visitor as soon as you can about any possible signs of infection so they can make sure you get the treatment you might need.

### Exercises

Strengthening the muscles around the vagina and anus by doing pelvic floor exercises can help with healing and will reduce the pressure on the cut and surrounding tissue.

Pelvic floor exercises involve squeezing the muscles around your vagina and anus as though to stop yourself from going to the toilet or farting.

A midwife can explain how to do the exercises. You can also read more about pelvic floor exercises on our page about [exercise in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/exercise/).

### Scar tissue

For a few women, excessive, raised or itchy [scar tissue](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/scars/) forms around the place where a tear happened or where an episiotomy was done. If your scar tissue is causing problems for you, tell your doctor.

Preventing a perineal tear
--------------------------

A midwife can help you avoid a tear during labour when the baby's head becomes visible.

The midwife will ask you to stop pushing and to pant or puff a couple of quick short breaths, blowing out through your mouth.

This is so your baby's head can emerge slowly and gently, giving the skin and muscles of the perineum time to stretch without tearing.

The skin of the perineum usually stretches well, but it may tear, especially in women who are giving birth for the first time.

Massaging the perineum in the last few weeks of pregnancy can reduce the chances of having an episiotomy during birth.

The type and frequency of massage varies across research studies. Most involve inserting 1 or 2 fingers into the vagina and applying downward or sweeping pressure towards the perineum.

The most benefit was in women who repeated this every day.

Title: Forceps or vacuum delivery

Assisted delivery
-----------------

An assisted birth (also known as an instrumental delivery) is when forceps or a ventouse suction cup are used to help deliver the baby.

Ventouse and forceps are safe and only used when necessary for you and your baby. Assisted delivery is less common in women who've had a spontaneous vaginal birth before.

What happens during a ventouse or forceps delivery?
---------------------------------------------------

Your obstetrician or midwife should discuss with you the reasons for having an assisted birth, the choice of instrument and how it will be carried out. Your consent will be needed before the procedure can be carried out.

Find out more about [consent to treatment](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/consent-to-treatment/).

You'll usually have a [local anaesthetic](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/local-anaesthesia/) to numb your vagina and the skin between your vagina and anus (perineum) if you have not already had an [epidural](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidural/).

If your obstetrician has any concerns, you may be moved to an operating theatre so a [caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/) can be carried out if needed.

It is likely a cut [(episiotomy)](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/episiotomy-and-perineal-tears/) will be needed to make the vaginal opening bigger. Any tear or cut will be repaired with stitches. Depending on the circumstances, your baby can be delivered and placed on your tummy, and your birth partner may still be able to cut the cord if they want to.

### Ventouse

A ventouse (vacuum cup) is attached to the baby's head by suction. A soft or hard plastic or metal cup is attached by a tube to a suction device. The cup fits firmly on to your baby's head.

During a contraction and with the help of your pushing, the obstetrician or midwife gently pulls to help deliver your baby.

If you need an assisted birth and you are giving birth at less than 36 weeks pregnant, then forceps may be recommended over ventouse. This is because forceps are less likely to cause damage to your baby's head, which is softer at this point in your pregnancy.

### Forceps

Forceps are smooth metal instruments that look like large spoons or tongs. They're curved to fit around the baby's head. The forceps are carefully positioned around your baby's head and joined together at the handles.

With a contraction and your pushing, an obstetrician gently pulls to help deliver your baby.

There are different types of forceps. Some are specifically designed to turn the baby to the right position to be born, such as if your baby is lying facing upwards (occipito-posterior position) or to one side (occipito-lateral position).

Why might I need ventouse or forceps?
-------------------------------------

An assisted delivery is used in about 1 in 8 births, and may be needed if:

*   you have been advised not to try to push out your baby because of an underlying health condition (such as having very high blood pressure)
*   there are concerns about your baby's heart rate
*   your baby is in an awkward position
*   your baby is getting tired and there are concerns that they may be in distress
*   you're having a vaginal delivery of a premature baby – forceps can help protect your baby's head from your perineum
*   you require an epidural for pain relief during labour

A children's doctor (paediatrician) is usually present to check your baby's condition after the birth. After the birth you may be given antibiotics through a drip to reduce your risk of getting an infection.

What are the risks of a ventouse or forceps birth?
--------------------------------------------------

Ventouse and forceps are safe ways to deliver a baby, but there are some risks that should be discussed with you.

### Vaginal tearing or episiotomy

This will be repaired with dissolvable stitches.

### 3rd or 4th degree vaginal tear

There's a higher chance of having a vaginal tear that involves the muscle or wall of the anus or rectum, known as a 3rd- or 4th-degree tear.

This kind of tear affects an estimated:

*   3 in every 100 women having a vaginal birth
*   4 in every 100 women having a ventouse delivery
*   8 to 12 in every 100 women having a forceps delivery

### Higher risk of blood clots

After an assisted birth, there's a higher chance of blood clots forming in the veins in your legs or pelvis. You can help prevent this by moving around as much as you can after the birth.

You may also be advised to wear special anti-clot stockings and have injections of heparin, which makes the blood less likely to clot.

### Urinary incontinence

Urinary incontinence (leaking pee) is not unusual after childbirth. It's more common after a ventouse or forceps delivery. You should be offered physiotherapy to help prevent this happening, including advice on pelvic floor exercises.

### Anal incontinence

Anal incontinence (involuntary farting or leaking poo) can happen after birth, particularly if there's been a 3rd or 4th degree tear. Because there's a higher risk of these tears happening with an assisted delivery, anal incontinence is more likely.

Are there any risks to the baby?
--------------------------------

The risks to your baby include:

*   a mark on your baby's head (chignon) being made by the ventouse cup – this usually disappears within 48 hours
*   a bruise on your baby's head (cephalohaematoma) – this can happen during a ventouse assisted delivery, but the bruise is usually nothing to worry about and should disappear with time
*   marks from forceps on your baby's face – these usually disappear within 48 hours
*   small cuts on your baby's face or scalp – these affect 1 in 10 babies born using assisted delivery and heal quickly
*   yellowing of your baby's skin and eyes – this is known as jaundice, and should pass in a few days

Afterwards
----------

You'll sometimes need a small tube that drains your bladder (a catheter) for up to 24 hours.

You're more likely to need this if you've had an epidural as you may not have fully regained sensation in your bladder and therefore do not know when it's full.

Title: What happens if your baby is breech?

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/if-your-baby-is-breech/

Published Time: 2 Dec 2020, 4:07 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Babies often twist and turn during pregnancy, but most will have moved into the head-down (also known as head-first) position by the time labour begins. However, that does not always happen, and a baby may be:

*   bottom first or feet first (breech position)
*   lying sideways (transverse position)

Bottom first or feet first (breech baby)
----------------------------------------

If your baby is lying bottom or feet first, they are in the breech position. If they're still breech at around 36 weeks' gestation, the obstetrician and midwife will discuss your options for a safe delivery.

### Turning a breech baby

If your baby is in a breech position at 36 weeks, you'll usually be offered an external cephalic version (ECV). This is when a healthcare professional, such as an obstetrician, tries to turn the baby into a head-down position by applying pressure on your abdomen. It's a safe procedure, although it can be a bit uncomfortable.

### Giving birth to a breech baby

If an ECV does not work, you'll need to discuss your options for a vaginal birth or [caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/) with your midwife and obstetrician.

If you plan a caesarean and then go into labour before the operation, your obstetrician will assess whether it's safe to proceed with the caesarean delivery. If the baby is close to being born, it may be safer for you to have a vaginal breech birth.

[The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) website has more information on what to expect if your baby is still breech at the end of pregnancy](https://www.rcog.org.uk/for-the-public/browse-our-patient-information/breech-baby-at-the-end-of-pregnancy-patient-information-leaflet/).

The RCOG advises against a vaginal breech delivery if:

*   your baby's feet are below its bottom – known as a "footling breech"
*   your baby is larger or smaller than average – your healthcare team will discuss this with you
*   your baby is in a certain position – for example, their neck is very tilted back, which can make delivery of the head more difficult
*   you have a low-lying placenta (placenta praevia)
*   you have [pre-eclampsia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/)

Lying sideways (transverse baby)
--------------------------------

If your baby is lying sideways across the womb, they are in the transverse position. Although many babies lie sideways early on in pregnancy, most turn themselves into the head-down position by the final trimester.

### Giving birth to a transverse baby

Depending on how many weeks pregnant you are when your baby is in a transverse position, you may be admitted to hospital. This is because of the very small risk of the umbilical cord coming out of your womb before your baby is born (cord prolapse). If this happens, it's a medical emergency and the baby must be delivered very quickly.

Sometimes, it's possible to manually turn the baby to a head-down position, and you may be offered this.

But, if your baby is still in the transverse position when you approach your due date or by the time labour begins, you'll most likely be advised to have a caesarean section.

Title: What complications can affect the placenta?

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/placenta-complications/

Published Time: 2 Dec 2020, 4:19 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Complications that can affect the placenta during pregnancy or childbirth include:

*   low-lying placenta and placenta praevia
*   retained placenta – when part of the placenta remains in the womb after giving birth
*   placental abruption – when the placenta starts to come away from the wall of the womb

These complications aren't common.

Low-lying placenta and placenta praevia
---------------------------------------

As your pregnancy progresses, your womb expands and this affects the placenta's position. The area where the placenta is attached usually stretches upwards, away from your cervix.

If the placenta stays low in your womb, near to or covering your cervix, it may block the baby's way out.

This is called low-lying placenta if the placenta is less than 2cm from the cervix, or placenta praevia if the placenta is completely covering the cervix.

Placenta praevia, where the cervix is completely covered at the end of pregnancy, affects about 1 in every 200 births.

The position of your placenta will be recorded at your 18- to 21-week [ultrasound scan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/ultrasound-scans/).

If your placenta is significantly low, you'll be offered an extra ultrasound scan later in your pregnancy (usually at about 32 weeks) to check its position again.

For 9 in every 10 women, the placenta will have moved into the upper part of the womb by this point.

If the placenta is still low in your womb, there's a higher chance that you could bleed during your pregnancy or during your baby's birth. This bleeding can be very heavy and put you and your baby at risk.

You may be advised to come into hospital at the end of your pregnancy so emergency treatment (such as a [blood transfusion](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-transfusion/)) can be given very quickly if you bleed.

If the placenta is near or covering the cervix, your baby can't be delivered through the vagina, so a [caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/) will be recommended.

A low-lying placenta can be associated with painless, bright red bleeding from the vagina during the last 3 months of pregnancy. If this happens to you, contact your midwife or GP immediately.

Retained placenta
-----------------

After your baby's born, part of the placenta or membranes can remain in the womb. This is known as retained placenta. If untreated, a retained placenta can cause life-threatening bleeding.

Breastfeeding your baby as soon as possible after the birth can help your womb contract and push the placenta out.

Your midwife may also ask you to change your position (for example, by moving to a sitting or squatting position). In some cases, you may be given an injection of a medicine to help your womb contract.

If these methods don't work, a doctor may need to remove the placenta by hand. This can be painful, so you'll be given an anaesthetic.

Placental abruption
-------------------

Placental abruption is a serious condition in which the placenta starts to come away from the inside of the womb wall.

It can cause stomach pain, bleeding from the vagina and frequent contractions.

It can also affect the baby, increasing the risk of [premature birth](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/premature-labour-and-birth/), growth problems and [stillbirth](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stillbirth/).

It's not clear what causes placental abruption, but factors that increase the risk include injury to the abdominal area, smoking, cocaine use and high blood pressure.

If you're near your due date, the baby will need to be born straight away and a [caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/) may be recommended.

But if the baby's very premature and the abruption is minor, you may be kept in hospital for close observation.

Always speak to your midwife or GP if you're concerned about any aspect of your health when you're pregnant. You can also call [NHS 111](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/urgent-and-emergency-care-services/when-to-use-111/).

**It's natural to focus on your baby's birth while you're pregnant. But it's a good idea to also know what to expect after labour.**

Skin-to-skin contact really helps with bonding. It's a good idea to have your baby lifted onto you as soon as they're born and before the cord is cut so you can be close to each other straight away.

Either before, or just after the cord is clamped, your baby will be dried and then covered with a towel to stop them getting cold. You can continue to hold and cuddle your baby while this is done.

Your baby may have some of your blood on their skin and perhaps vernix, the greasy white substance that protects your baby's skin in the womb.

If you prefer, you can ask the midwife to dry your baby and wrap them in a blanket before your cuddle.

Mucus may need to be cleared out of your baby's nose and mouth.

Some babies need a bit of help to get their breathing established.

Your baby may be taken to another part of the room to have some oxygen. They'll be brought back to you as soon as possible.

Your baby will be examined by a midwife, neonatal nurse or paediatrician, then weighed and possibly measured, and given a wrist or ankle band with your name on.

Your midwife or maternity support worker will help you wash and freshen up before you go to the postnatal ward.

Vitamin K for newborn babies
----------------------------

You'll be offered an injection of vitamin K for your baby. This helps prevent a rare bleeding disorder called haemorrhagic disease of the newborn.

Your midwife should have discussed the injection with you while you were pregnant.

If you'd prefer for your baby not to have an injection, they can have vitamin K by mouth instead, but they'll need further doses.

Stitches for tears or cuts
--------------------------

Small tears and grazes are often left without stitches because they can usually heal without treatment.

If you need stitches or other treatments, you should be able to carry on cuddling your baby while this is being done.

If you have had a large tear or an [episiotomy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/episiotomy-and-perineal-tears/), you'll need stitches.

If you have already had an [epidural](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidural/), it can be topped up. If you haven't, you should be offered a local anaesthetic to numb the area.

Preventing bleeding after the birth
-----------------------------------

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a complication where you bleed heavily from the vagina after your baby's birth.

There are 2 types of PPH, depending on when the bleeding takes place:

*   primary or immediate – bleeding that happens within 24 hours of birth
*   secondary or delayed – bleeding that happens after the first 24 hours and up to 12 weeks after the birth

Sometimes PPH happens because your womb doesn't contract strongly enough after the birth.

It can also happen because part of the placenta has been left in your womb or you get an infection in the lining of the womb (endometritis).

To help prevent PPH, you'll be offered an injection of oxytocin as your baby is being born. This stimulates contractions and helps to push the placenta out.

**Advice about stitches, piles, bleeding and other physical changes after birth, plus tips to help you make a healthy recovery.**

If you've had a caesarean, see [recovering from a caesarean](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/recovery/).

Stitches
--------

If you've had stitches after tearing or an [episiotomy (cut)](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/episiotomy-and-perineal-tears/), bathe them every day to help prevent infection. Have a bath or shower with plain warm water then carefully pat yourself dry.

If your stitches are sore or uncomfortable, tell your midwife.

Painkillers can help. If you're breastfeeding, check with a pharmacist, midwife or GP before you buy over-the-counter painkillers.

Stitches usually dissolve by the time the cut or tear has healed, but sometimes they have to be taken out.

Going to the toilet
-------------------

At first, the thought of peeing can be a bit frightening – because of the soreness. Drinking lots of water dilutes your urine, which may make it sting less.

Tell your midwife if:

*   you're finding it really difficult to pee
*   you feel very sore
*   you notice an unpleasant smell

You probably won't have a poo for a few days after the birth, but it's important not to let yourself get [constipated](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/constipation/).

Eat plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, salad, wholegrain cereals and wholemeal bread, and drink plenty of water.

If you've had stitches, it's very unlikely you'll break them, or open up the cut or tear again.

It might feel better if you hold a pad of clean tissue over the stitches when pooing. Try not to strain.

Talk to your midwife or GP if you have constipation that won't go away. A gentle laxative may help.

Also tell your midwife or GP if poo is leaking or you're pooing when you don't mean to.

Bladder control
---------------

After having a baby, it's quite common to leak a bit of pee if you laugh, cough or move suddenly.

Pelvic floor exercises can help with this but tell the GP at your postnatal check if they aren't. They may refer you to a physiotherapist.

Find out more about [your post-pregnancy body, including how to do pelvic floor exercise](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/support-and-services/your-post-pregnancy-body/).

Piles
-----

[Piles (haemorrhoids)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/piles-haemorrhoids/) are very common after birth but usually disappear within a few days or weeks.

Eat plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, salad, wholegrain cereals and wholemeal bread, and drink plenty of water. This should make pooing easier and less painful.

Try not to push or strain – this will make the piles worse.

Talk to a midwife or pharmacist if you feel very uncomfortable. They can recommend creams and ointments that soothe piles.

Bleeding after birth (lochia)
-----------------------------

You'll bleed from your vagina after the birth. It will be quite heavy at first, and you'll need super-absorbent period pads. Change them regularly, washing your hands before and afterwards.

It isn't a good idea to use tampons until after [your 6-week postnatal check](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/support-and-services/your-6-week-postnatal-check/) because they could increase your chance of getting an infection.

You may notice the bleeding is redder and heavier when you breastfeed. This happens because breastfeeding makes your womb contract. You may also feel cramps similar to period pains.

The bleeding will carry on for a few weeks. It will gradually turn a brownish colour and decrease until it finally stops.

If you're losing blood in large clots, tell your midwife. You may need some treatment.

When will my periods start again after pregnancy?
-------------------------------------------------

When will my periods start again after pregnancy?

It's hard to be exact about when your periods will start again, as everyone is different.

If you bottle feed your baby, or combine bottle feeding with breastfeeding, your first period could start as soon as 5 to 6 weeks after you give birth.

If you fully breastfeed (including at night) without any bottle feeding, your periods may not start again until you start to reduce breastfeeding.

How soon after giving birth can I get pregnant?
-----------------------------------------------

You can get pregnant again just 3 weeks after the birth of your baby, even if you're breastfeeding and your periods have not started again yet.

It's important to start using contraception within 21 days of giving birth to avoid a new pregnancy. Talk to your midwife or GP about a method that's best for you.

Find out more about [choosing a method of contraception](https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/choosing-contraception/).

How soon can I use tampons after giving birth?
----------------------------------------------

You should not use tampons until you've had your [6-week postnatal check](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/support-and-services/your-6-week-postnatal-check/). This is because you'll still have a wound where the placenta joined with the wall of your womb, and you may also have tears or cuts in or around your vagina.

Using internal period products like tampons and menstrual cups before this wound has healed could increase your chance of getting an infection.

Use maternity or period pads during this time while your body is still healing.

Breasts
-------

To begin with, your breasts will produce a yellowish liquid called colostrum for your baby.

On the third or fourth day, they may feel tight and tender as they start to produce milk.

Wearing a supportive nursing bra may help. Speak to your midwife if you're very uncomfortable.

Read more about [breastfeeding in the first few days](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/breastfeeding-and-bottle-feeding/breastfeeding/the-first-few-days/).

Tummy
-----

After delivery, your tummy will probably still be a lot bigger than before pregnancy. This is partly because your muscles have stretched.

If you eat a balanced diet and get some exercise, your shape should gradually return.

Breastfeeding helps because it makes your womb contract. You may feel quite painful period-like cramps while you're feeding.

Find out more about [your post-pregnancy body, including exercises to help separated stomach muscles](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/support-and-services/your-post-pregnancy-body/).

Is it something serious?

**You'll probably spend a large part of the first few days after birth looking at your baby.**

If you notice anything that worries you about your baby, however small, speak to your midwife.

Within the first 24 hours, a health professional will offer to give your baby an injection of vitamin K. This is to prevent a rare but serious blood disorder.

You will also be offered a [newborn physical examination](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/newborn-screening/physical-examination/) for your baby in their first 72 hours. Among other things, their eyes, heart, hips and testicles (if they have them) will be checked for possible problems.

In their first few weeks, you baby will also have the:

*   [newborn hearing screening](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/newborn-screening/hearing-test/)

Umbilical cord care
-------------------

Your newborn’s umbilical cord takes about a week to dry out and drop off. Keep it clean and dry until it does. If you notice any bleeding or discharge, tell your midwife, health visitor or GP.

Fontanelles (soft spots)
------------------------

On the top of your baby's head, near the front, is a diamond-shaped patch where the skull bones have not fused together yet. There is another, smaller, soft spot towards the back of their head. These are called the fontanelles.

It will probably be a year or more before the bones close over. Do not worry about touching the fontanelles as they are covered by a tough protective membrane.

Your baby's skin
----------------

At birth, the top layer of your baby's skin is very thin and easily damaged. Over the first month, or longer for premature babies, your baby's skin matures and develops its own natural protective barrier.

Vernix, the white sticky substance that covers your baby's skin while in the womb, should always be left on the skin. It's a natural moisturiser that also protects against infection in the first few days.

It's best to bath your baby with plain water only for at least the first month. Do not add cleansers to your baby's bath water or use skin lotions or medicated wipes.

Premature babies' skin is even more delicate. Staff in the neonatal unit will advise you on skincare.

Find out more about [babies who need special care](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/after-the-birth/special-care-ill-or-premature-babies/).

If your baby was overdue, their skin may be dry and cracked. This is because all the protective vernix has been absorbed before they were born.

Eyes in newborns
----------------

Your newborn's eyes will be checked shortly after birth as part of their newborn physical examination. New babies can see, but their vision is not very focused. Their eyesight develops gradually over the first few months.

Your newborn's eyes may roll away from each other occasionally. This is called a [squint](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/squint/) and is normal in a newborn. It should go away by 4 months. Talk to your health visitor or GP if it does not.

Bumps and bruises
-----------------

It's common for a newborn baby to have some swelling and bruises on their head, and perhaps bloodshot eyes.

This is caused by squeezing and pushing during birth, and is particularly common in babies who have been delivered by forceps or ventouse. It will soon disappear but, if you're worried, you can ask your midwife about it.

Birthmarks
----------

The most common birthmarks in newborns are little pink or red V-shaped marks on the forehead, upper eyelids or neck. Some people call these stork marks or salmon patches. Marks on the face tend to fade gradually, but marks on the neck can take longer to go away.

Dark red and slightly raised strawberry marks (infantile haemangioma) are quite common. They sometimes appear a few days or weeks after birth and gradually get bigger. They may take a while to go away, but they usually disappear gradually.

See more about [birthmarks](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/birthmarks/).

Newborn spots
-------------

Spots and rashes are very common in newborn babies. They may come and go, but if you also notice a change in your baby's behaviour – for example, if your baby is not feeding well, or is very sleepy or very irritable – tell your midwife or GP immediately.

Breasts and genitals in newborns
--------------------------------

Quite often, a newborn’s breasts are a little swollen and ooze some milk, whether they are a boy or a girl.

Your newborn's genitals may appear swollen initially but will look normal within a few weeks. Baby girls also sometimes bleed a bit or have a white, cloudy discharge from the vagina.

All this is caused by hormones passing from you to your baby before birth. Do not be concerned.

Boys' testicles develop inside their body and sometimes take a while to descend into the scrotum. A health professional will check whether they have descended as part of the newborn physical examination.

Jaundice in newborn babies
--------------------------

When they're about 2 to 3 days old, some babies develop mild jaundice. This will make the whites of their eyes and their skin look a bit yellow (this may be less obvious on brown or black skin). It's caused by pigments released during the breakdown of old red blood cells.

It usually fades on its own within about 10 days, but more severe jaundice may need treatment.

Find out about [newborn jaundice](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/jaundice-newborn/).

If your baby develops jaundice in their first 24 hours, they should be checked by a health professional straight away.

Instincts in new babies
-----------------------

Babies are born knowing how to suck. During the first few days they learn to co-ordinate their sucking with their breathing during feeding.

Newborn babies also automatically turn towards a nipple or teat if it's brushed against their cheek, and they'll open their mouths if their upper lip is stroked.

Immunity in newborns
--------------------

You pass your antibodies to your baby during pregnancy. Antibodies are part of the immune system and help protect against bacteria and viruses.

The antibodies you pass to your baby will help protect them against infection for the first few weeks after birth.

It's important that vaccines are given at the right times to offer the best protection. Your baby's first vaccinations are offered at 8 weeks.

Your baby after the birth
-------------------------

Having skin-to-skin contact with your baby straight after the birth can help keep her or him warm and can help with getting breastfeeding started.

### First feed, weight gain and nappies

Some babies feed immediately after birth and others take a little longer.

The midwives will help you whether you choose to:

*   [breastfeed](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/breastfeeding-and-bottle-feeding/breastfeeding/benefits/)
*   [feed with formula](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/breastfeeding-and-bottle-feeding/bottle-feeding/formula-milk-questions/)
*   [combine breast and bottle feeds](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/breastfeeding-and-bottle-feeding/bottle-feeding/combine-breast-and-bottle/)

It's normal for babies to lose some weight in the first few days after birth. Putting on weight steadily after this is a sign your baby is healthy and feeding well.

Read more about [your baby's weight](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/babys-development/height-weight-and-reviews/baby-height-and-weight/), and [your baby's nappies, including healthy poo](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/caring-for-a-newborn/how-to-change-your-babys-nappy/).

### Tests and checks for your baby

A children's doctor (paediatrician), midwife or newborn (neonatal) nurse will check your baby is well and will offer him or her a [newborn physical examination](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/newborn-screening/physical-examination/) within 72 hours of birth.

In the early days, the midwife will check your baby for signs of:

*   [jaundice](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/jaundice-newborn/)
*   infection of the umbilical cord or eyes
*   thrush in the mouth

On day 5 to 8 after the birth, you'll be offered the [blood spot (heel prick) test](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/newborn-screening/blood-spot-test/) for your baby.

Before you baby is 5 weeks old you should be offered a [newborn hearing screening test](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/newborn-screening/hearing-test/).

If [your baby is in special care](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/after-the-birth/special-care-ill-or-premature-babies/), these tests may be done there. If your baby is at home, the tests may be done at your home by the community midwife team.

Learn how to [tell when a baby is seriously ill](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/health/is-your-baby-or-toddler-seriously-ill/).

### Safe sleeping for your baby

Make sure you know how to put your baby to sleep safely to [reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/caring-for-a-newborn/reduce-the-risk-of-sudden-infant-death-syndrome/).

### 2 weeks and beyond

You don't need to [bathe your baby](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/caring-for-a-newborn/washing-and-bathing-your-baby/) every day. You may prefer to wash their face, neck, hands and bottom carefully instead.

Most babies will regain their birthweight in the first 2 weeks. Around this time their care will move from a midwife to a health visitor.

The health visitor will check your baby's growth and development at regular appointments and record this in [your baby's personal child health record (PCHR)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/babys-development/height-weight-and-reviews/baby-reviews/), also known as their "red book".

You after the birth
-------------------

The maternity staff caring for you will check you're recovering well after the birth.

They will take your temperature, pulse and blood pressure.

They'll also feel your tummy (abdomen) to make sure your womb is shrinking back to its normal size.

Some women feel tummy pain when their womb shrinks, especially when they're breastfeeding. This is normal.

### Seeing a midwife or health visitor

Midwives will agree a plan with you for visits at home or at a children's centre until your baby is around 10 days old. This is to check that you and your baby are well and support you in these first few days.

### Bleeding after the birth (postnatal bleeding)

You'll have bleeding (lochia) from your vagina for a few weeks after you give birth.

The bleeding usually stops by the time your baby is 12 weeks old.

### Non-urgent advice: Speak to your GP, midwife or health visitor if you've got postnatal bleeding and any of these:

*   a high temperature over 38C
*   the bleeding smells unusual for you
*   tummy pain that gets worse
*   the bleeding gets heavier or doesn't get any less
*   lumps (clots) in the blood
*   pain between the vagina and anus (perineum) that gets worse

It could be a sign of infection.

Make sure you know the signs of a serious heavy bleed after giving birth (postpartum haemorrhage, or PPH). This is rare and needs emergency care.

### Immediate action required: Call 999 if you've got postnatal bleeding and:

*   the bleeding suddenly gets heavier
*   you feel faint, dizzy or have a pounding heart

This could mean you're having a very heavy bleed (postpartum haemorrhage) and need emergency treatment.

Read more about [your body after the birth](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/after-the-birth/your-body/), including when you might need urgent medical attention.

### Feeding your baby

When you're [breastfeeding in the early days](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/breastfeeding-and-bottle-feeding/breastfeeding/the-first-few-days/), breastfeed your baby as often as they want. This may be every 2 hours.

Let your baby decide when they've had enough (this is called baby-led feeding).

You can [express your breast milk](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/breastfeeding-and-bottle-feeding/breastfeeding/expressing-breast-milk/) if you're having [problems with breastfeeding](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/breastfeeding-and-bottle-feeding/breastfeeding-problems/). Problems can include breast engorgement or [mastitis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/mastitis/).

Get [breastfeeding and bottle feeding advice](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/breastfeeding-and-bottle-feeding/).

### Your baby's crying

Crying is your baby's way of telling you they need comfort and care. It can be hard to know what they need, especially in the early days.

There are ways you can [soothe your crying baby](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/caring-for-a-newborn/soothing-a-crying-baby/).

### How you feel

Find out [how to cope if you feel stressed after having a baby](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/support-and-services/coping-with-stress-after-having-a-baby/). There are [support services for new parents](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/support-and-services/services-and-support-for-parents/) that may help.

You may feel a bit down, tearful or anxious in the first week after giving birth. This is normal.

If these feelings start later or last for more than 2 weeks after giving birth, it could be a sign of [postnatal depression](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/post-natal-depression/overview/).

Postnatal depression and anxiety are common, and there is treatment. Speak to your midwife, GP or health visitor as soon as possible if you think you might be depressed or anxious.

### Sex and contraception

You can have sex as soon as you feel ready after having a baby.

There are no rules about when to have sex after giving birth. Every woman's physical and emotional changes are different.

Information:

You can get pregnant from 3 weeks (21 days) after giving birth. This can happen before you have a period, even if you're breastfeeding.

You need to start using contraception from 21 days after the birth every time you have sex if you don't want to get pregnant again.

Talk to your doctor, midwife or contraception (family planning) nurse about [contraception after having a baby](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/support-and-services/sex-and-contraception-after-birth/). They can arrange contraception before you have sex for the first time.

### Exercise

Being active may feel like a challenge when you're tired, but gentle exercise after childbirth can help your body recover and may help you feel more energetic.

You should also do [pelvic floor exercises](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/lifestyle/what-are-pelvic-floor-exercises/) to strengthen the muscles around your bladder, vagina and anus.

Neonatal care in hospital
-------------------------

Special care for babies is sometimes provided on the ordinary postnatal ward and sometimes in a specialist newborn (neonatal) area.

Having a baby in neonatal care can be worrying, but the staff looking after your baby should make sure you receive all the information, communication and support you need.

Not all hospitals provide specialist neonatal services, so your baby may be transferred to another hospital if they need special care.

Why babies need special care
----------------------------

Your baby could be admitted to neonatal care for a number of reasons, including when they:

*   are [born early (premature)](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/premature-labour-and-birth/)
*   are very small and have a low birthweight
*   have an infection
*   have [jaundice](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/jaundice-newborn/)
*   had a very difficult birth
*   are waiting for, or recovering from, complex surgery

Touching and holding your baby
------------------------------

The special care baby unit may seem strange and confusing at first, especially if your baby is in an incubator or on a breathing machine. There may also be tubes and wires attached to their face and body.

Ask the nurse to explain what everything is for and show you how you can be involved in your baby's care. You may be able to change your baby's nappy, wash them and change their clothing.

Once your baby is stable, you'll be able to hold them. The nurses will be able to help you take your baby out of the incubator and show you how to have skin-to-skin contact.

Your baby will benefit greatly from physical contact with you. You can talk to your baby as well – this can help both of you.

You should wash your hands carefully and dry them thoroughly before touching your baby.

Feeding
-------

To begin with, your baby may be too small or too sick to feed themselves. You can [express some of your breast milk](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/breastfeeding-and-bottle-feeding/breastfeeding/expressing-breast-milk/), which can be given to your baby through a tube.

A fine tube is passed through their nose or mouth into their stomach. This will not hurt them.

Talk to a midwife at the hospital about how you can express breast milk for your baby. The hospital may have breast pumps you can use.

Your milk has particular benefits, especially if your baby is sick or premature, as it's enriched with proteins (such as antibodies), fats and minerals.

If your baby is not able to have your milk to begin with, the milk can be frozen and given to them when they're ready.

When you go home, you can express milk for the nurses to give while you're away. There's no need to worry about how much milk you produce – every bit helps your baby.

Incubators
----------

Babies who are very small are nursed in incubators rather than cots to keep them warm. You can still have a lot of contact with your baby.

Some incubators have open tops, but if your baby's incubator does not, you can put your hands through the holes in the side of the incubator to stroke and touch them.

Newborn babies with jaundice
----------------------------

[Jaundice in newborn babies](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/jaundice-newborn/) is common. Jaundice will make the whites of their eyes and their skin look a bit yellow, although yellowing of the skin can be more difficult to see on brown or black skin.

Babies with severe jaundice may be treated with light therapy (phototherapy). The baby is undressed and put under a very bright light, usually with soft eye pads or a special box over their head to protect their eyes.

The special light helps break down the chemical that causes jaundice. It may be possible for your baby to have phototherapy by your bed in the postnatal ward so you do not have to be separated.

Light treatment may continue for several days, with breaks for feeds, before the jaundice clears up. Sometimes, if the jaundice gets worse, your baby may need a blood transfusion. This is not common.

Some babies have jaundice because of [liver disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/liver-disease/) and need different treatment. A blood test that checks for liver disease is done before phototherapy is started.

Find out more about [how newborn jaundice is treated](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/jaundice-newborn/treatment/).

### Babies with jaundice after 2 weeks

Many babies are jaundiced for up to 2 weeks after they're born, or 3 weeks in premature babies.

It's more common in breastfed babies and does no harm. It's not a reason to stop breastfeeding.

If your baby is still jaundiced after 2 weeks, tell your GP, midwife or health visitor the same day, especially if their poo is chalky white or they have dark pee. This can indicate a liver problem.

A blood test will distinguish between jaundice that will go away by itself and jaundice that may need urgent treatment.

Babies with disabilities
------------------------

If your baby is disabled, talk to people about how you feel, as well as about your baby's health and future.

Your GP, a doctor for newborn babies (neonatologist), a children's doctor (paediatrician) or your health visitor can all help you.

You can also contact the hospital [Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS)](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/nhs-services-and-treatments/what-is-pals-patient-advice-and-liaison-service/), or your social services department for information about local organisations that may be able to help.

[Find your local authority on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-council)

The organisations listed here can offer help and advice:

*   [Bliss](http://www.bliss.org.uk/) – offer advice for parents of premature and sick babies, including [looking after your mental health](https://www.bliss.org.uk/parents/support/impact-mental-health-premature-sick-baby)
*   [Contact](http://www.cafamily.org.uk/) – for families with disabled children
*   [Living made easy](http://www.dlf.org.uk/) – for advice on all types of daily living equipment for disabled adults and children
*   [Genetic Alliance UK](http://www.geneticalliance.org.uk/) – supporting those affected by a genetic condition
*   [Group B Strep Support](http://www.gbss.org.uk/) – preventing group B strep infection in newborn babies
*   [Peeps](https://www.peeps-hie.org/) – for those affected by hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)
*   [Mind](http://www.mind.org.uk/) – for better mental health

Talking to other parents with similar experiences can also often help.

Worries and explanations
------------------------

Hospital staff should explain what kind of treatment your baby is being given and why. If they do not tell you, ask them.

It's important that you understand what's happening so you can work together to make sure your baby gets the best possible care.

Some treatments need your consent to go ahead, and the doctors will discuss this with you.

It's natural to feel anxious if your baby needs special care. Talk over any fears or worries with the hospital staff. Hospitals often have their own counselling or support services, and a number of charities run support and advice services.

The consultant neonatologist or paediatrician should arrange to see you, but you can also ask for an appointment at any time if you wish.

The hospital social worker may be able to help with practical issues, such as travel costs or help with looking after children.

**If your partner is violent**
------------------------------

Domestic abuse or domestic violence can be physical, sexual, emotional, psychological or financial. It is often a combination of these.

Pregnancy can be a trigger for domestic abuse, and existing abuse may get worse during pregnancy or after giving birth.

Domestic abuse during pregnancy puts you and your unborn child in danger. It increases the risk of miscarriage, infection, premature birth, and injury or death to the baby.

It can also cause [emotional and mental health problems](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/mental-health/), such as stress and anxiety, which can affect the development of the baby.

Find out more about [domestic violence and abuse](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/getting-help-for-domestic-violence/).

**Getting help**
----------------

If you're pregnant and being abused, get help. You can speak in confidence to a:

*   GP
*   midwife
*   obstetrician
*   health visitor
*   social worker

Information about you will not be shared with other services without your permission, unless there's a concern that your unborn child or other children in your family, or someone else, is at risk of serious harm.

You can also get support from:

*   the 24-hour [freephone National Domestic Abuse Helpline, run by Refuge](https://www.nationaldahelpline.org.uk/) – call 0808 2000 247 for free confidential advice

**Pregnancy brings big changes to your life, especially if this is your first baby. Some people find it easier to cope with these changes than others do. Everybody is different.**

Your feelings
-------------

Even if you feel excited about having your baby, it's also common to feel vulnerable and anxious while pregnant.

If feeling down or anxious is affecting your everyday life, tell a midwife. You will be offered help to deal with worrying thoughts or feelings.

Find out more about [mental health in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/mental-health/).

Your relationship
-----------------

You may find that you are having arguments with your partner while you’re pregnant.

Some arguments may have nothing to do with the pregnancy, but others may be caused by feeling worried about the future and how you're going to cope.

It's important to talk with your partner about how you’re feeling. If you are worried about your relationship, talk to a friend, family member or your midwife.

Domestic abuse
--------------

If your relationship is abusive or violent, get help. There are organisations that can help such as:

*   [Women's Aid](http://www.womensaid.org.uk/), which works to keep women and children safe
*   [galop: The LGBT+ anti-violence charity](http://www.galop.org.uk/)

Find out more about [domestic abuse in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/support/domestic-abuse-in-pregnancy/).

Support in labour
-----------------

If you have a partner, they may want to be present at the baby's birth. It can help to find out about your birth options, including [where you can give birth](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/where-to-give-birth-the-options/).

You can also find out about [what your birth partner can do to support you](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/tips-for-your-birth-partner/), and what it can mean for them to share this experience.

If you do not have a partner, you may have family or a friend you could ask to be your birth partner.

Involve your birth partner in antenatal classes if you can, and let them know what you want. It may help to discuss your birth plan with them so they understand your wishes for labour.

Having a baby if you're on your own
-----------------------------------

If you’re on your own, ask your midwife if there are antenatal classes in your area that are especially for single people.

After birth, it can be encouraging to meet other single parents who also went through pregnancy on their own.

[Gingerbread](http://www.gingerbread.org.uk/) is a self-help organisation for single-parent families. It has a network of local groups and can give you information and advice. The charity can also put you in touch with other parents in a similar situation to you.

Visit the [Gingerbread online forum](https://www.gingerbread.org.uk/community/online-forum/) (registration required).

Money and housing
-----------------

If money is an immediate concern, find out more about the [maternity and paternity benefits and leave](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/finding-out/maternity-and-paternity-benefits-and-leave/) you're entitled to claim. Your local Jobcentre Plus or Citizens Advice service can advise you.

If you have a housing problem, contact your local Citizens Advice or your local housing advice centre.

You might be eligible for a [Sure Start Maternity Grant on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/sure-start-maternity-grant), or [Healthy Start](https://www.healthystart.nhs.uk/) vouchers for free milk, vegetables and vitamins.

**If you continue with your pregnancy after screening has found something, you might need extra care.**

The care you and your baby need depends on the condition they have.

Support is available for any condition your baby has.

Important
---------

Speak to a doctor or midwife to get as much information as possible about your baby's condition and what treatment they might need.

Your pregnancy care
-------------------

You'll be offered all the regular checks and tests everyone has when they're pregnant.

And you'll be cared for by a team that's specially trained to support you and your baby's needs.

But depending on your baby's condition and what's available in your area, you may need to:

*   go for extra scans or appointments
*   see specialist doctors (obstetricians or paediatricians)
*   travel further to a specialist hospital for appointments

You can bring your partner, a family member or friend with you.

It might help to write down any questions you have before you go.

Information:

**You could ask things like:**

*   Will we need extra support during the birth?
*   Will my baby need treatment straight after birth?
*   Where will this treatment take place?
*   Will my baby need to stay in hospital?
*   If they do, how long will that be for?
*   How will my baby develop?

Your birth plan
---------------

Everyone who's pregnant can make a birth plan. You'll usually talk this through with a midwife early in your pregnancy.

You can talk about:

*   who you want with you during labour
*   your options around pain relief
*   your positions for labour and birth
*   where's best to have your baby
*   what care you and your baby may get

[Find out more about making a birth plan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/how-to-make-a-birth-plan/)

But depending on your baby's condition, you may need to make changes to your plan.

[The charity SOFT UK can help you with making a birth plan if your baby might be born with a condition](http://www.soft.org.uk/birth-plan)

Giving birth
------------

You may have a higher chance of going into labour early. Or your baby may need more support when they're born.

This may mean you'll need to:

*   give birth at a specialist hospital with intensive and special care baby units – [the charity Bliss has more about the different levels of neonatal care](https://www.bliss.org.uk/parents/in-hospital/about-neonatal-care/how-does-neonatal-care-work)
*   give birth at hospital in a unit led by a doctor (obstetrician)
*   have a [caesarean](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/) instead of a vaginal birth
*   have your baby earlier than your due date (by being induced or having a caesarean)

Speak to a doctor or midwife to find out your options.

The team are there to make sure you and your baby have all the support you need.

[Read about what happens during labour and giving birth](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/the-stages-of-labour-and-birth/)

**After your baby is born**
---------------------------

What happens after your baby is born depends on their condition and how severe it is. Your baby may need to:

*   stay in hospital for a while after they're born
*   have further treatment from a specialist doctor
*   have further tests and checks as they get older

A doctor or midwife will explain the next steps for your baby's care.

Support is available
--------------------

It can help to speak to:

*   your partner, family or friends
*   your midwife or specialist doctor
*   a local support group
*   charities for your baby's condition
*   a counsellor – you do not need a referral from your GP ([find out more about how to see a counsellor](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/counselling/))

Published Time: 2 Dec 2020, 6:51 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Finding out you're pregnant when you're a teenager can be daunting, especially if the pregnancy was not planned. But help and support is available.

First, if you think you might be pregnant but you're not sure, it's important to take a [pregnancy test](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/trying-for-a-baby/doing-a-pregnancy-test/) as soon as possible to find out.

I'm pregnant. What should I do next?
------------------------------------

If your pregnancy test is positive, it's understandable to feel mixed emotions: excitement about having a child, worry about telling your parents, and anxiety about pregnancy and childbirth.

You may also be feeling worried or frightened if you're not sure that you want to be pregnant.

Make sure you talk through your options and think carefully before you make any decisions. Try talking to a family member, friend or someone you trust.

Whatever your age, you can also ask for confidential advice from:

*   a GP or practice nurse
*   a contraception or sexual health clinic
*   NHS 111 – available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year

It's your decision, but do not ignore the situation, hoping it will go away.

Your options are:

*   continuing with the pregnancy and keeping the baby
*   having an [abortion](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/abortion/)
*   continuing with the pregnancy and having the baby adopted

If you decide to continue your pregnancy, the next step is to start your [antenatal care](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/your-antenatal-care/).

If you decide not to continue with your pregnancy, you can talk to a GP or visit a sexual health clinic to discuss your options.

They can refer you for an assessment at a clinic or hospital if you choose to have an abortion.

*   [Brook: adoption](https://www.brook.org.uk/your-life/adoption/)

What support is there for pregnant teenagers?
---------------------------------------------

If you decide to continue with your pregnancy, there are a wide range of services to support you during pregnancy and after you've had your baby.

You can get support and advice from:

*   [Brook](https://www.brook.org.uk/) – visit your nearest Brook service for free confidential advice

*   [Family Nurse Partnership](https://fnp.nhs.uk/find-us/) – a family nurse may be able to visit your home, if you're young parents, to support you from early pregnancy until your child is 2
*   [Shelter](https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/housing_for_young_people/housing_options_for_young_parents) – a national housing charity that can advise you about housing options and housing benefits for young parents; visit their website or call them on 0808 800 4444

If you're pregnant and on your own, it's important there are people you can share your feelings with who can offer you support.

Can I carry on with my education while I'm pregnant?
----------------------------------------------------

### At school

You can stay at school up until the birth and then return to school afterwards.

Taking time away from school to have a baby is treated like any other leave of absence. Schools are expected to act reasonably and grant a sufficient period of leave from school, taking into consideration the specific circumstances of each case.

You can leave school on the last Friday in June if you’ll be 16 by the end of the summer holidays.

But until you're 18, you still have to either:

*   stay in full-time education (for example, at college)
*   start an apprenticeship or traineeship
*   work or volunteer (for 20 hours or more a week) while in part-time education or training

The law says colleges, universities or your apprenticeship employer are not allowed to treat you unfairly if you're pregnant or have had a baby.

[GOV.UK: school leaving age](https://www.gov.uk/know-when-you-can-leave-school)

### Further or higher education

You can only get maternity pay if you have a job, so very few students are eligible.

But if you're a student, you should be able to take maternity-related absence from studying after your baby has been born. How long you take will depend on your situation and your particular course.

Markdown Content:
If tests show your baby has a serious condition (an anomaly), find out as much as you can from your doctor about the condition and how it might affect your baby.

Hearing the diagnosis can be very shocking and you may find it hard to take in.

You may need to spend some time thinking things through and go back and talk to the doctor with your partner or someone close to you.

Information:

The charity [Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC)](https://www.arc-uk.org/) offers information and support for people who have received a diagnosis after antenatal screening.

You can call the ARC helpline on (020) 7713 7486 Monday to Friday, 10am to 5.30pm, or email [info@arc-uk.org](mailto:info@arc-uk.org) for an evening call from 8pm to 10pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

You can also text 07908 683004.

You may be offered a termination (abortion) to end the pregnancy.

Some couples wish to continue with the pregnancy and prepare for the needs of their newborn baby, while others decide to terminate the pregnancy.

What happens
------------

There are 2 main types of termination:

*   medical termination – taking medicine to end the pregnancy
*   surgical termination – a procedure to remove the pregnancy

You're likely to have bleeding and cramping for several days after having either type of termination.

You should be offered a choice of which method you would prefer whenever possible.

A medical termination allows for a detailed examination of the baby (post-mortem) that can help find out the exact nature of the baby's condition.

Tests can be done after both a medical and surgical termination to see if the baby was carrying a genetic disorder.

This may help your doctor to determine the chance of you having another baby with a similar problem.

Medical termination
-------------------

A medical termination involves taking medicine to end the pregnancy. It doesn't require surgery or an anaesthetic, and can be used at any stage of pregnancy.

It involves the following steps:

1.  Taking a medicine to stop an essential pregnancy hormone. Without this hormone, the pregnancy can't continue.
2.  Usually 24 to 48 hours later, you have another appointment where you take a second medicine – a tablet that you either take by mouth or put inside your vagina. You may need more than 1 dose.
3.  The lining of the womb breaks down, causing bleeding and loss of the pregnancy. This may take several hours and can be painful. You'll be offered pain relief to help.

When a medical termination is carried out after 9 weeks of pregnancy, you may need to stay overnight in the clinic or hospital.

Occasionally, the pregnancy doesn't pass completely and an operation is needed to remove it.

Surgical termination
--------------------

There are 2 ways you can have a surgical termination.

It usually involves having a local anaesthetic (where the area is numbed), conscious sedation (where you're relaxed but awake) or general anaesthetic (where you're asleep).

### Vacuum or suction aspiration

This can be used before 14 weeks of pregnancy. It involves inserting a tube through your vagina and into the entrance to the womb (the cervix). The pregnancy is then removed using suction.

Vacuum aspiration takes 5 to 10 minutes, and you can usually go home a few hours later.

### Dilatation and evacuation (D&E)

This is used from 14 weeks of pregnancy. It involves inserting special instruments called forceps through the cervix and into the womb to remove the pregnancy.

D&E is usually carried out under sedation or general anaesthetic. It normally takes 10 to 20 minutes, and you might be able to go home the same day.

Seeing and holding your baby
----------------------------

You may wish to think beforehand about whether you want to see and perhaps hold your baby, and whether you want to give your baby a name.

If you don't want to see the baby, you could ask hospital staff to take a photograph for you in case you change your mind in the future. The photograph can be kept in your notes.

Holding your baby or having a photograph is only possible with a medical termination of pregnancy.

Having a funeral
----------------

You may wish to think about having a burial or cremation for your baby. Talk to the doctor, nurse or midwife at your hospital about your options.

After a termination
-------------------

It can help to talk. If your family and friends find it difficult to understand what you're going through, you could make contact with people who have had a similar experience.

The charities [Antenatal Results and Choices](https://www.arc-uk.org/) and [Tommy's](https://www.tommys.org/baby-loss-support/tfmr-terminating-pregnancy-medical-reasons) can help.

Title: When pregnancy goes wrong

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/support/when-pregnancy-goes-wrong/

Published Time: 2 Dec 2020, 7 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Sadly, sometimes pregnancy can go wrong. You may have a miscarriage, an ectopic pregnancy, birth trauma or the death of the baby.

If your pregnancy ends in this way, you will need both information and support. Talk to the people close to you about how you feel, and to your midwife, doctor or health visitor about what's happened and why.

Sometimes it is easier to talk to someone outside your family and friends. There are lots of organisations offering information and support, including [The Lullaby Trust](https://www.lullabytrust.org.uk/bereavement-support/), [Bliss](https://www.bliss.org.uk/parents/coping-with-loss/bereavement), [Miscarriage Association](https://www.miscarriageassociation.org.uk/) and [The Birth Trauma Association](https://www.birthtraumaassociation.org/home).

Ectopic pregnancy
-----------------

An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg implants outside the womb, usually in a fallopian tube. The pregnancy is not viable as the fertilised egg can't develop properly. Also, your health may be at serious risk if the pregnancy continues.

The warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy can start soon after a missed period, but occasionally there are no noticeable symptoms.

Find out more about [ectopic pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ectopic-pregnancy/), including symptoms, treatments, and help and support afterwards.

Miscarriage
-----------

A miscarriage is when a pregnancy is lost before 24 weeks. They are very common.

Many early miscarriages (before 12 weeks) happen because there is something wrong with the baby. A later miscarriage may be due to an infection, problems in the placenta, or the cervix being weak and opening too early in the pregnancy.

A miscarriage can start like a period, with spotting or bleeding.

Find out more about [miscarriage](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/miscarriage/), including symptoms, treatment options, your care and coping afterwards.

Losing a baby
-------------

In some pregnancies, the baby dies before it's born (stillbirth) or soon after (neonatal death). Losing a baby in this way is a huge shock.

Read more about [stillbirth](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stillbirth/), and where you can get help and support.

Termination for foetal anomaly
------------------------------

In some pregnancies, [screening tests](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/screening-tests/) may find a serious health condition in the baby. You will probably be very shocked when you are first told and will need to take time to think things through. In this situation, some couples decide to terminate the pregnancy.

Read about [termination for foetal anomaly](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/support/termination-for-fetal-anomaly/), what is involved, and where you can get help and support.

Birth trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes labour or birth can be traumatic and cause [PTSD](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/overview/). This may be because of a painful birth or unplanned or emergency treatment.

You may be angry that your birth did not go how you expected and it may make you anxious about having another baby in future.

It’s important to [get help for PTSD](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/treatment/).
