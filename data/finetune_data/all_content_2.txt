Markdown Content:
Pregnancy happens when sperm enters a vagina, travels through the cervix and womb to the fallopian tube and fertilises an egg.

You're more likely to get pregnant around the time you are ovulating. This is when an egg becomes ready and you are at your most fertile.

If you are under 40 and have regular sex without using contraception, there is an 8 in 10 chance you will get pregnant within 1 year.

How to increase your chances of getting pregnant
------------------------------------------------

There are things you and your partner can do to increase the chances of getting pregnant.

### Do

*   have sex every 2 to 3 days without using contraception – make sure sperm enters the vagina
    
*   try to have sex around the time you are ovulating – this is usually 12 to 16 days before your period starts
    
*   try to maintain a [healthy weight](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/), stop drinking alcohol and [do not smoke](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/quit-smoking/) – it can help if your partner does this too
    

Information:

If you're trying to get pregnant it's important to take [folic acid](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/vitamins-supplements-and-nutrition/) every day, eat a healthy diet, and avoid drinking alcohol. This will help your baby develop healthily.

Non-urgent advice: See a GP if:
-------------------------------

*   you have been trying to get pregnant for over 1 year
*   you have a long term condition such as [diabetes](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetes/) and want advice about pregnancy
*   there is a risk of passing on a condition such as [sickle cell disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sickle-cell-disease/) to your baby
*   you regularly take medicines and want to get pregnant – some medicines can affect a pregnancy
*   you are aged 36 or over and want to get pregnant

If you have a mental health condition, or did in the past, being pregnant can make you unwell again.

Severe mental health conditions such as [psychosis](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/psychosis/overview/), [schizophrenia](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/schizophrenia/overview/) or [bipolar disorder](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/bipolar-disorder/overview/) are more likely to make you unwell again.

Everyone’s mental health journey is different, but whatever happens, you will have a team of people supporting you. This may include midwives, GPs and mental health specialists.

Non-urgent advice: Speak to a GP if:
------------------------------------

*   you have a mental health condition and are worried about getting pregnant
*   you’re taking medicine for a mental health condition and you want to get pregnant

### Important: If you're trying to get pregnant or have found out you're pregnant

Do not stop taking medicine for your mental health condition without speaking to a GP – this can make your condition come back or get worse.

Treatment
---------

The 2 types of treatment for mental health problems in pregnancy are [talking therapies](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/benefits-of-talking-therapies/) and medicine.

If you take medicine while you’re pregnant your doctor will explain how this may affect your baby. Try not to worry – you’ll be offered the safest medicine at the lowest dose that will still work.

You can improve your chances of getting pregnant and having a healthy pregnancy by following the steps on this page.

Take a folic acid supplement
----------------------------

It's recommended that you should take a daily supplement of folic acid when you're pregnant, or when there's a chance you might get pregnant.

You should take a 400 microgram supplement of folic acid every day before you get pregnant, and every day afterwards, up until you're 12 weeks pregnant.

A microgram is 1,000 times smaller than a milligram (mg). The word microgram is sometimes written with the Greek symbol μ followed by the letter g (μg).

Folic acid reduces the risk of your baby having a neural tube defect, such as [spina bifida](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/spina-bifida/).

A neural tube defect is when the foetus's spinal cord (part of the body's nervous system) does not form normally.

You might be advised to take a higher dose supplement of 5 milligram (5mg) every day.

You may need to take a 5mg supplement of folic acid if:

*   you or the baby's other biological parent have a neural tube defect
*   you previously had a pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect
*   you or the baby's other biological parent have a family history of neural tube defects
*   you have diabetes

Your doctor may also recommend a a 5mg supplement if you take certain medicines, such as anti-epilepsy medicine or anti-retroviral medicine for HIV.

Talk to a GP if you think you need a 5mg dose of folic acid, as they can prescribe a higher dose.

You can get folic acid tablets at pharmacies, or talk to a GP about getting a prescription.

Do not worry if you get pregnant unexpectedly and were not taking a folic acid supplement at the time. Start taking them as soon as you find out, until you're past the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

Stop smoking
------------

[Smoking during pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/stop-smoking/) has been linked to a variety of health problems, including:

*   premature birth
*   low birth weight
*   [sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-sids/), also known as cot death
*   [miscarriage](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/miscarriage/)

Quitting can be hard, no matter how much you want to, but support is available.

[NHS Quit Smoking](https://www.nhs.uk/smokefree) offers free help, support and advice on stopping smoking, including when you're pregnant, and can give you details of local support services.

Smoke from other people's cigarettes can damage your baby, so ask your partner, friends and family not to smoke near you.

Cut out alcohol
---------------

Do not drink alcohol if you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant. Alcohol can be passed to your unborn baby.

Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to your baby, and the more you drink, the greater the risk.

Find out about [alcohol and pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/drinking-alcohol-while-pregnant/).

Keep to a healthy weight
------------------------

If you're overweight, you may have problems getting pregnant and fertility treatment is less likely to work.

Being overweight (having a BMI over 25) or obese (having a BMI over 30) also raises the risk of some pregnancy problems, such as [high blood pressure](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/complications/high-blood-pressure/), [deep vein thrombosis,](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/complications/deep-vein-thrombosis/) [miscarriage](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/miscarriage/) and [gestational diabetes](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gestational-diabetes/).

Before you get pregnant you can calculate your BMI. But this may not be accurate once you're pregnant, so consult your midwife or doctor.

Having a healthy diet and doing moderate exercise are advised in pregnancy, and it's important not to gain too much weight.

You can keep to a healthy weight by having a [balanced diet](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/) and doing regular exercise.

[Read more about exercise in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/exercise/)

Know which medicines you can take
---------------------------------

Not all medicines are safe to take when you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy, whether they're on prescription or medicines you can buy in a pharmacy or shop.

Information:

If you take prescribed medicine and you're planning to get pregnant, talk to a doctor.

Do not stop taking your medicine without talking to a doctor.

[Find out about medicines in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/medicines/).

Vaccinations and infections
---------------------------

Some infections, such as [rubella (German measles)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/rubella/), can harm your baby if you catch them during pregnancy.

Most people in the UK are immune to rubella, thanks to the uptake of the [measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/mmr-vaccine/).

If you have not had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, or you're not sure if you have, ask your GP surgery to check your vaccination history.

If you have not had both doses or there's no record available, you can have the vaccinations at your GP surgery.

You should avoid getting pregnant for 1 month after having the MMR vaccination, which means you'll need a reliable method of [contraception](https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/).

Talk to a doctor if you have a long-term condition
--------------------------------------------------

If you have a long-term condition, such as epilepsy or diabetes, it could affect the decisions you make about your pregnancy – for example, where you might want to give birth.

Before you get pregnant, have a discussion with your specialist or a GP about getting pregnant.

You can also talk to your GP if you have a mental health condition and are planning to get pregnant. They may be able to refer you to a specialist mental health team who offer support before, during and after pregnancy.

If you're taking medicine for a condition, do not stop taking it without talking to a doctor.

Testing for sickle cell and thalassaemia
----------------------------------------

Sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassaemia are inherited blood disorders that mainly affect people whose ancestors come from Africa, the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, India, Pakistan, south and Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.

If you are pregnant and live in England you will be offered screening tests for these disorders, but you do not have to wait until you're pregnant before you have a test.

If you or your partner are concerned you may be a carrier for 1 of these disorders, perhaps because someone in your family has a blood disorder or is a carrier, it's a good idea to get tested before starting a family.

You can ask for a free blood test from either a GP or a local sickle cell and thalassaemia centre.

Published Time: 2 Dec 2020, 4:44 p.m.

Markdown Content:
If you have missed a period and recently had unprotected sex, you may be pregnant. Pregnancy tests are most reliable from the first day of your missed period.

When you can do a pregnancy test
--------------------------------

You can carry out most pregnancy tests from the first day of a missed period. If you don't know when your next period is due, do the test at least 21 days after you last had unprotected sex.

Some very sensitive pregnancy tests can be used even before you miss a period.

You can do a pregnancy test on a sample of urine collected at any time of the day. It doesn't have to be in the morning.

Where you can get a pregnancy test
----------------------------------

You can buy pregnancy testing kits from pharmacists and some supermarkets. They can give a quick result and you can do the test in private.

The following places provide free pregnancy tests:

*   [sexual health services](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/sexual-health-services/)
*   some young people's services – call the national sexual health helpline on 0300 123 7123 for details
*   [Brook centres](https://www.brook.org.uk/) for under-25s – [find your nearest Brook centre](https://www.brook.org.uk/find-a-service/)

You may also be able to get a pregnancy test free of charge from your GP.

How does a pregnancy test work?
-------------------------------

All pregnancy tests detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), which starts to be produced around 6 days after fertilisation.

Most pregnancy tests come in a box that contains 1 or 2 long sticks. You pee on the stick and the result appears on the stick after a few minutes. All tests are slightly different, so always check the instructions.

Will a pregnancy test work if I'm on the pill?
----------------------------------------------

Yes.

Some methods of contraception, such as the [contraceptive pill](https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/methods-of-contraception/combined-pill/), contain hormones, but these hormones will not stop a pregnancy test working.

No method of contraception is completely effective, so it's important to take a pregnancy test if you think you might be pregnant.

Pregnancy test results
----------------------

Home pregnancy tests are accurate as long as you follow the instructions correctly.

A positive test result is almost certainly correct. However, a negative test result is less reliable.

The result may not be reliable if you:

*   do not follow the instructions properly
*   take the test too early

Some medicines can also affect the results.

If you get a negative result and still think you're pregnant, wait a few days and try again. Speak to your GP if you get a negative result after a second test but your period has not arrived.

Continuing with the pregnancy
-----------------------------

If you're pregnant and want to continue with the pregnancy, contact your GP or a midwife to start your [antenatal care](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/your-antenatal-care/). You can use the [pregnancy due date calculator](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/finding-out/due-date-calculator/) to work out when your baby is due.

If you're not sure you want to be pregnant
------------------------------------------

If you're not sure about continuing with the pregnancy, you can discuss this confidentially with a healthcare professional. Your options are:

*   continuing with the pregnancy and keeping the baby
*   having an [abortion](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/abortion/)
*   continuing with the pregnancy and having the baby adopted

As well as a GP or a nurse at your GP surgery, you can also get accurate, confidential information – from the age of 13 – from the following:

*   [sexual health services](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/sexual-health-services/)
*   the [MSI Reproductive Choices](https://www.msichoices.org.uk/) website
*   the [British Pregnancy Advisory service](https://www.bpas.org/) website
*   the [National Unplanned Pregnancy Advisory service](https://www.nupas.co.uk/) website

All these services – including community contraceptive clinics – are confidential. If you're 13 or older, the staff won't tell your parents. They'll encourage you to talk to your parents, but they won't force you.

If you're under 25 and would prefer advice specifically for young people, the sexual health charity [Brook](https://www.brook.org.uk/) provides a range of services for young people. The Brook website contains information on pregnancy choices. You can also use the [Ask Brook 24/7 service](https://www.brook.org.uk/help-advice/).

Early signs of pregnancy
------------------------

Every pregnancy is different and not everyone will notice all of these symptoms.

If you're worried about any symptoms you're having, talk to a GP or your midwife.

### Missed or lighter period

If you have a regular monthly menstrual cycle, the earliest and most reliable sign of pregnancy is a missed period.

In the first few weeks of pregnancy you may have a bleed similar to a very light period, with some spotting or only losing a little blood. This is called implantation bleeding.

### Feeling sick during pregnancy

You may feel sick or be sick. Although commonly known as "morning sickness", [vomiting and morning sickness](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/vomiting-and-morning-sickness/) can happen at any time of the day or night.

Symptoms usually start when you’re around 4 to 6 weeks pregnant.

If you're being sick all the time and cannot keep anything down, see a GP.

You may have [hyperemesis gravidarum](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/complications/severe-vomiting/), a serious condition in pregnancy that causes severe vomiting and needs treatment.

### Feeling tired is common in pregnancy

It's common to feel tired, or even exhausted, during pregnancy, especially during the first 12 weeks or so.

Hormonal changes in your body at this time can make you feel tired, sick, emotional and upset.

### Sore breasts in early pregnancy

Your breasts may become larger and feel tender, just as they might do before your period. They may also tingle.

The veins may be more visible, and the nipples may darken and stand out.

### Peeing more can suggest pregnancy

You may feel the need to pee more often than usual, including during the night.

Other signs of pregnancy you may notice are:

*   constipation
*   more [vaginal discharge](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/vaginal-discharge/) (without any soreness or irritation)

### Strange tastes, smells and cravings

During early pregnancy, you may find you no longer like some foods or drinks you used to enjoy.

You might notice:

*   a strange taste in your mouth, which some describe as metallic
*   you crave new foods
*   you lose interest in certain foods or drinks you used to enjoy, such as tea, coffee or fatty food
*   you lose interest in smoking
*   you're more sensitive to certain smells, for example the smell of food or cooking

Home pregnancy tests
--------------------

If you do a home pregnancy test, a positive test result is almost certainly correct, as long as you have followed the instructions correctly.

A negative result is less reliable. If you get a negative result and still think you may be pregnant, wait a week and try again.

If you're pregnant, use the pregnancy [due date calculator](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/finding-out/due-date-calculator/) to work out when your baby's due.

It's impossible to say how long it takes to get pregnant because it's different for each woman.

Many factors can affect a couple's chances of conceiving, such as:

*   your age
*   your general health
*   your reproductive health
*   how often you have sex

Some women become pregnant quickly, while others take longer. This may be upsetting, but it's normal.

Fertility
---------

Most couples will get pregnant within a year if they have regular sex and don't use contraception.

But women become less fertile as they get older.

The effect of age on men's fertility is less clear.

What does 'regular sex' mean?
-----------------------------

Having regular sex means having sex every 2 to 3 days throughout the month.

Some couples may try to time having sex with when the woman ovulates (releases an egg).

But do not worry about the timing of when you have sex if it makes you feel stressed.

Fertility problems
------------------

Lots of factors can cause fertility problems, including:

*   hormonal (endocrine) disorders, such as [polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos/) and problems with the thyroid or pituitary glands
*   physical disorders, such as [obesity](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/obesity/), [anorexia nervosa](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/anorexia/) or excessive exercise
*   disorders of the reproductive system, such as infections, blocked fallopian tubes, [endometriosis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/endometriosis/) or a low sperm count
*   [menopause](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/menopause/)

Some of these factors affect either women or men.

The most common causes are ovulation failure (which can be caused by lots of different things) and sperm disorders.

Read more detailed information about the [causes of infertility](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/infertility/causes/).

Getting help
------------

If you have been trying for a baby for 1 year without success, see your GP for advice.

**You can increase your chances of getting pregnant again if you are in good health.**

It is also important that your partner is healthy. A bad diet, smoking, drinking and unhealthy working conditions can affect the quality of sperm and prevent pregnancy happening.

Folic acid
----------

You should take a 400 microgram folic acid tablet every day while trying to get pregnant up until you're 12 weeks pregnant.

It reduces the risk of having a baby born with defects of the brain, spine or spinal cord, such as [spina bifida](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/spina-bifida/). You can get these tablets from a supermarket or pharmacist.

It's also good to eat foods that contain this important vitamin. These include leafy green vegetables, and breakfast cereals and breads with added folic acid.

You'll need a bigger dose of folic acid if:

*   you or the baby's other biological parent have defects of the brain, spine or spinal cord (these are known as neural tube defects)
*   you or the baby's other biological parent have a family history of neural tube defects
*   you have had a previous pregnancy that was affected by a neural tube defect
*   you have [coeliac disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coeliac-disease/)
*   you have [diabetes](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetes/)
*   you take [anti-epileptic medicine](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epilepsy/treatment/)
*   you take anti-retroviral medicine for HIV
*   you have a [BMI](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/) of 30 or over

Women with the blood disorders [sickle cell](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sickle-cell-disease/) or [thalassaemia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/thalassaemia/) (or thalassaemia trait) should take folic acid 5 mg daily throughout pregnancy.

Ask a GP for advice.

Rubella (german measles) and pregnancy
--------------------------------------

[Rubella](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/rubella/) is rare in the UK thanks to the uptake of the [measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/mmr-vaccine/).

But if you get the infection in early pregnancy, it can lead to serious birth defects and miscarriage.

If you're not sure whether you've had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, ask your GP practice to check.

You can have the vaccinations at your GP practice if you have not had both doses or there's no record available.

You should avoid getting pregnant for 1 month after having the MMR vaccination.

Be aware that the MMR vaccine is not suitable if you are already pregnant.

Diabetes and epilepsy
---------------------

Talk to your doctor before you try to get pregnant if you have [diabetes](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetes/). You'll need some extra care during pregnancy.

You should also talk to your doctor if you have [epilepsy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/existing-health-conditions/epilepsy/). Some medicines used to treat epilepsy can cause birth defects.

There should be alternative epilepsy medicines that your doctor can recommend.

Mental health and pregnancy
---------------------------

If you previously experienced a mental health condition such as [postnatal depression](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/post-natal-depression/overview/), [postpartum psychosis](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/post-partum-psychosis/) or [PTSD](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/overview/), talk to your doctor before you try to get pregnant.

You may have experienced a birth trauma and are anxious about having another baby. Your doctor or midwife will listen to any concerns you have and can personalise your care.

Find out more about [getting pregnant if you have a mental health condition.](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/trying-for-a-baby/getting-pregnant-if-you-have-a-mental-health-condition/)

Vaginal birth after caesarean section
-------------------------------------

If you previously had a caesarean section, it is likely that you can have a vaginal delivery with your next baby.

It partly depends on why you had a caesarean section and how many caesareans you've had. A GP, midwife or obstetrician will be able to advise you.

You'll be advised to have a caesarean with your next baby if you:

*   previously had a uterine rupture (a tear in the wall of your womb)
*   previously had womb surgery
*   have a vertical scar on your uterus
*   have placenta praevia (where the neck of the uterus is blocked by the placenta)

After 1 caesarean section, you are likely to go on and have a vaginal delivery with your next pregnancy if the pregnancy is straightforward.

But if problems occur throughout labour, the midwife and obstetrician could advise that you have a caesarean section. This is because of the risk of complications that may arise as a result of previous scarring.

Cervical screening test
-----------------------

If you're due to have [cervical screening](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cervical-screening/) (a smear test), you should have this test before you try to get pregnant.

If you're invited for a routine smear test while you're pregnant you should tell your GP or clinic you're pregnant. You will usually be advised to reschedule the test for a date around 12 weeks after your baby is born.

Read more about [health things you should know in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/finding-out/health-things-you-should-know-in-pregnancy/), including cervical screening.

You and your partner's weight and fertility
-------------------------------------------

It can improve your chances of getting pregnant if you and your partner are a healthy weight.

This is particularly important if you or your partner are [living with obesity](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/obesity/) (have a BMI of 30 or more) as this means you're likely to have lower fertility.

Before you get pregnant, you can find out whether you're a healthy weight and get advice with the [BMI healthy weight calculator.](https://www.nhs.uk/health-assessment-tools/calculate-your-body-mass-index/)

Speak to a GP or practice nurse if you need help or advice.

Medicines and drugs while trying
--------------------------------

Some medicines can harm your baby if you take them while you're pregnant, while others are safe to take.

If either you or your partner take medicine regularly, talk to your doctor about any possible effects on fertility or pregnancy.

Do this ideally before you start trying for a baby or as soon as you find out you're pregnant.

Check with your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before you take any over-the-counter medicines or herbal remedies.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
--------------------------------------

STIs can affect your health and your ability to get pregnant. If there's any chance you or your partner have an STI, it's important to get it diagnosed and treated before you get pregnant.

STIs can be passed on through unprotected sex with an infected person. Some STIs can be passed on from one person to another without penetration.

[HIV](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids/), [hepatitis B](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hepatitis-b/) and [hepatitis C](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hepatitis-c/) can also be passed on by sharing equipment for injecting drugs, such as needles.

If you’re HIV positive, treatment is available to prevent you passing on the virus to your baby during pregnancy or at birth. You can still pass on HIV by breastfeeding.

Read [living with HIV and AIDS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids/living-with/) to find out more about pregnancy and HIV.

Fertility and where you work
----------------------------

If you or your partner are exposed to X-rays or pesticides where you work, it may affect your fertility.

Talk to a GP if you're concerned. They can advise you about any possible risks to your fertility.

Finding it hard to get pregnant?
--------------------------------

It can take a while to get pregnant the second or third time around, even if it happened very quickly the last time.

There are several ways you could become a parent if getting pregnant by having sex is not an option for you.

Possible ways to become a parent include:

*   donor insemination
*   IUI (intrauterine insemination)
*   surrogacy
*   adoption or fostering
*   co-parenting

There are also several ways that could help people with fertility problems have a baby, including [IVF (in vitro fertilisation)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ivf/).

IUI and IVF can sometimes be done on the NHS. This depends on things like your age. Check with a GP or [local integrated care board (ICB)](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/find-your-local-integrated-care-board/) to find out about what might be available to you.

Surrogacy is not available on the NHS.

All these options can be explored by anyone, including single people and same sex couples.

Donor insemination
------------------

Sperm is put inside the person getting pregnant. This can be done at home, with sperm from a licensed fertility clinic, a sperm bank or someone you know.

If you choose donor insemination, it’s better to go to a licensed fertility clinic where the sperm is checked for infections and some inherited conditions. Fertility clinics can also offer support and legal advice.

If the sperm is not from a licensed fertility clinic, the person donating the sperm can get tested for sexually transmitted infections at a sexual health clinic.

In the UK, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) makes sure licensed fertility clinics run safely and legally.

*   [HFEA: fertility clinic search](https://www.hfea.gov.uk/choose-a-clinic/clinic-search/)

IUI (intrauterine insemination)
-------------------------------

In [IUI (intrauterine insemination)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/intrauterine-insemination-iui/) sperm is put in the womb of the person getting pregnant. This is done at a licensed fertility clinic. The sperm can be from someone you know or from a sperm bank.

A licensed fertility clinic will check the sperm for sexually transmitted infections and inherited conditions.

[Find a licensed clinic with HFEA's fertility clinic search](https://www.hfea.gov.uk/choose-a-clinic/clinic-search/).

Co-parenting
------------

This is when 2 or more people team up to conceive and parent children together.

As a co-parent, you will not have sole custody of the child. It's advisable to get legal advice at an early stage of your planning.

There are many details to think about, such as how you'll split financial costs.

Adoption or fostering 
----------------------

You can apply to adopt or foster through a local authority, or an adoption or foster agency. You do not have to live in the local authority you apply to, and you can be single.

You’ll have to complete an assessment before adopting or fostering, with the help of a social worker and preparation training.

*   [GOV.UK: child adoption](https://www.gov.uk/child-adoption)
*   [GOV.UK: becoming a foster parent](https://www.gov.uk/becoming-foster-parent)

Surrogacy
---------

Surrogacy is when someone has a baby for people who cannot, or choose not to, get pregnant themselves.

In the UK either sperm or egg can be from a donor, but not both.

Surrogacy is legal in the UK, but it's illegal to advertise for surrogates and the surrogate cannot be paid a fee.

Testosterone therapy uses an artificial version of the testosterone hormone.

It's given to people for a number of reasons, including as a treatment for [gender dysphoria](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gender-dysphoria/) in people who want to change how their body looks and works.

Testosterone can reduce breast tissue, stop periods, and make hair grow on your face.

Testosterone and fertility
--------------------------

It is possible to get pregnant if you’re taking testosterone, but it's not recommended. This is because taking testosterone in pregnancy may affect the baby's development.

If you are taking testosterone and want to get pregnant, talk to the doctor who is prescribing you testosterone.

### Important: Testosterone and contraception

You can get pregnant while taking testosterone.

You need to use contraception if you do not want to get pregnant.

Testosterone and pregnancy
--------------------------

Taking testosterone in pregnancy is not recommended.

Do not stop taking testosterone before talking with the doctor who is prescribing it for you.

If you stop taking testosterone you’ll probably start to have periods. You may also notice changes in your body shape around your hips, chest and thighs.

You should not notice any changes to your tone of voice or facial hair.

If you get pregnant, you may have mood swings, such as suddenly feeling very irritable or tearful. These are common in most pregnancies.

You may find being pregnant triggers feelings of gender dysphoria.

Find out about [mental health in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/mental-health/).

### Urgent advice: Contact the doctor who is prescribing your testosterone immediately if:

*   you are taking testosterone and think you might be pregnant

Testosterone and chestfeeding
-----------------------------

If you have taken testosterone in the past then your milk supply may be affected. So you may not be able to chestfeed your baby.

If you can chestfeed and you also decide to start taking testosterone again, your milk will have small amounts of testosterone in it.

It is unclear what, if any, effect this could have on your baby.

It is also important to consider your own wellbeing if you are finding that not taking testosterone is triggering dysphoria.

Talk to your midwife or doctor about any concerns you may have.

Markdown Content:
Chestfeeding is feeding your baby with milk from your chest.

If you’re able to chestfeed, it’s your decision whether you do and you can change your mind at any time. You will be fully supported in any decisions you make.

Chestfeeding if you’ve had top surgery
--------------------------------------

If you’ve had top surgery to remove soft tissue, you may still be able to chestfeed or express your milk.

It is not possible to know how much milk you will produce and if it will be enough for your baby. You may need to offer your baby supplementary feeds.

Your baby may find it difficult to latch on to your nipple if there is less soft tissue available. In this case, talk to your midwife.

### Non-urgent advice: Speak to your midwife or a GP if:

*   you want to take testosterone while chestfeeding

Testosterone can decrease your milk supply. Your midwife or a GP can advise you.

**Binding while chestfeeding**
------------------------------

If you bind (reduce the appearance of soft tissue by flattening your chest) and are chestfeeding, there may be a higher chance of you getting an infection called mastitis.

Mastitis is when your chest becomes swollen, hot and painful. You may want to try wearing a larger size binder than before.

Speak to your midwife or a GP if you think you may have mastitis.

Skin-to-skin contact
--------------------

Skin-to-skin contact with your newborn is a great way to bond with your baby.

Skin-to-skin means holding your baby naked or dressed only in a nappy against your skin.

It’s good to do at any time and will help to comfort you and your baby over the first few weeks as you get to know each other.

You should contact your GP surgery or local midwife service as soon as you find out you're pregnant (before 8 weeks into the pregnancy).

It's important to see a midwife as early as possible to get the [antenatal (pregnancy) care](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/your-antenatal-care/) and information you need to have a healthy pregnancy.

If you’re not registered with a GP, you can [find a GP](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-GP) in your area and contact them to register.

Your pregnancy can be treated confidentially, even if you're under 16. A GP or midwife can tell you about your choices for antenatal care in your local area. Being pregnant may affect the treatment of any current illness or conditions you have or later develop.

Read about the [signs and symptoms of pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/trying-for-a-baby/signs-and-symptoms-of-pregnancy/) and [doing a pregnancy test](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/trying-for-a-baby/doing-a-pregnancy-test/).

Important: Coronavirus (COVID-19) update
----------------------------------------

If you're well, it's really important you go to all your appointments and scans for the health of you and your baby.

If you're pregnant, hospitals and clinics are making sure it's safe for you to go to appointments.

If you get symptoms of COVID-19, or you're unwell with something other than COVID-19, speak to your midwife or maternity team. They will advise you what to do.

[Find out more about pregnancy and COVID-19](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/pregnancy-and-covid-19/)

Knowing that you're pregnant
----------------------------

When you find out you're pregnant, you may feel happy and excited, or shocked, confused and upset. Everybody is different.

Some of this may be caused by changes in your hormone levels, which can make you feel more emotional.

If you're feeling anxious or worried it will help to talk to someone. Read about [mental health in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/mental-health/).

However you're feeling, contact an NHS professional (such as a midwife, GP or practice nurse) so you can start getting [antenatal care](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/your-antenatal-care/). This is the care that you'll receive leading up to the birth of your baby.

Find out about your [schedule of antenatal appointments](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/your-antenatal-appointments/).

Partners
--------

Partners may also have mixed feelings when they find out you're pregnant. They may find it hard to talk about their feelings because they do not want to upset you. Both of you should encourage each other to talk about your feelings and any worries or concerns.

Telling people that you're pregnant
-----------------------------------

You may want to tell your family and friends that you're pregnant immediately or wait a while until you know how you feel. Or you may want to wait until you've had your first [ultrasound scan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/ultrasound-scans/), when you're around 12 weeks pregnant, before you tell people.

Some of your family or friends may have mixed feelings or react in unexpected ways to your news. You may wish to discuss this with a midwife.

Your first appointment with a midwife should happen before you're 10 weeks pregnant.

If you're more than 10 weeks pregnant and have not seen a GP or midwife, contact a GP or midwife as soon as possible. They'll see you quickly and help you start your pregnancy (antenatal) care.

What is pregnancy (antenatal) care?
-----------------------------------

This is the care you have while you're pregnant to make sure you and your baby are as well as possible.

The NHS in England will offer you:

*   10 pregnancy appointments (7 if you've had a child before) to check the health and development of you and your baby
*   screening tests to find out the chance of your baby having certain conditions, such as Down's syndrome
*   blood tests to check for syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B
*   screening for inherited blood disorders (sickle cell and thalassaemia)

You'll be offered more appointments if you or your baby need them.

Depending on your health and where you live, you may see:

*   a midwife for all your appointments
*   a midwife for some appointments and a GP for others

How do I start my pregnancy care?
---------------------------------

As soon as you find out you're pregnant you can book an appointment with:

*   local midwife services ([find maternity services near you](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/Maternity-services/LocationSearch/1802))
*   your GP (if you're not registered with a GP you can [find local GPs](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-GP))

Your first midwife appointment
------------------------------

This appointment lasts around an hour.

Your midwife will ask questions to make sure you get the care that's right for you.

They will ask about:

*   any other pregnancies or children
*   smoking, alcohol and drug use

*   a hospital

You'll usually go to the hospital for your pregnancy scans.

As soon as you find out you are pregnant, contact a GP or midwife and they will help you book your first appointment.

Your first midwife appointment (also called the booking appointment) should happen before you're 10 weeks pregnant. This is because you'll be offered some tests that should be done before 10 weeks.

If you're more than 10 weeks pregnant and have not seen a GP or midwife, contact a GP or midwife as soon as possible.

You'll still have your first midwife appointment and start your NHS pregnancy journey.

Where the first appointment happens
-----------------------------------

Your first appointment may take place in:

*   your home
*   a hospital
*   a GP surgery
*   a Children's Centre

Where the appointment happens depends on the pregnancy services in your area.

How long the appointment lasts
------------------------------

The appointment usually takes around an hour.

What your midwife may ask
-------------------------

Your midwife will ask some questions to help find out what care you need.

They may ask about:

*   where you live and who you live with
*   the baby's father
*   any other pregnancies or children
*   smoking, alcohol and drug use
*   your physical and mental health, and any issues or treatment you've had

*   domestic abuse
*   female genital mutilation (FGM)
*   your job, if you have one
*   whether you have people around to help and support you, for example a partner or family members

The first appointment is a chance to tell your midwife if you need help or are worried about anything that might affect your pregnancy. This could include domestic abuse or violence, sexual abuse, or [female genital mutilation (FGM)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/female-genital-mutilation-fgm/).

FGM can cause problems during labour and birth. It's important you tell your midwife or doctor if this has happened to you.

Tests at your first appointment
-------------------------------

Your midwife will ask if they can:

*   measure your height and weight, and work out your body mass index (BMI)
*   measure your blood pressure and test your urine for signs of [pre-eclampsia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/)
*   take blood tests to check your general health and blood group, and to see if you have [HIV, syphilis or hepatitis B](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/screening-for-hepatitis-b-hiv-and-syphilis/)

They'll also offer you a [blood test for sickle cell and thalassaemia](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/screening-for-sickle-cell-and-thalassaemia/) (blood disorders that can be passed on to the baby) if they think there's a high chance you might have them. They'll work out your chance by asking some questions.

Things your midwife may discuss with you
----------------------------------------

Your midwife may give you information about:

*   how the baby develops during pregnancy
*   a [healthy pregnancy diet](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/have-a-healthy-diet/) and [foods to avoid in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/foods-to-avoid/)
*   [pregnancy exercise](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/exercise/) and pelvic floor exercises
*   your NHS pregnancy (antenatal) care
*   breastfeeding
*   antenatal classes
*   benefits you can get when you're pregnant, such as free prescriptions and free dental care
*   your options for where to have your baby
*   the tests and scans you'll be offered in pregnancy

Ask questions if you want to know more or do not understand something.

Your maternity notes
--------------------

At the end of the first appointment, your midwife will give you your maternity notes. The notes may be digital in an app or website or written down in a book or folder.

These notes are a record of your health, appointments and test results in pregnancy. They also have useful phone numbers, for example your maternity unit or midwife team.

Information:

You should have these notes with you all the time until you have your baby. This is so healthcare staff can read about your pregnancy health if you need urgent medical care.

-----------------------

For all X-rays, you should let the hospital know if you're pregnant.

X-rays are not usually recommended during pregnancy unless it's an emergency

Cervical screening during pregnancy
-----------------------------------

You will not usually need to have cervical screening if you're pregnant, or could be pregnant, until at least 12 weeks after you've given birth. This is because pregnancy can make it harder to get clear results.

If you're already pregnant and due for a cervical screening test then tell the GP or clinic.

You will usually be advised to reschedule the test for a date around 12 weeks after your baby is born.

If you've previously had an abnormal result from a cervical screening test, you may need to be screened while you're pregnant. Your GP or midwife may ask you to have a cervical screening test at your first antenatal appointment. This test will not affect your pregnancy.

What if I have a health condition?
----------------------------------

If you have a health condition, for example, diabetes or asthma, it can affect your pregnancy. Pregnancy can also affect any conditions you have.

Information:

Do not stop taking your medicine until you've talked to your doctor.

Fake tan in pregnancy
---------------------

Fake tan creams are generally thought to be safe to use in pregnancy. Test them on a small area of skin first and follow the instructions.

Avoid using spray tans, as the effects of breathing in the spray are not known.

Do not use tanning pills as they contain ingredients that may be toxic to an unborn baby.

Paint fumes in pregnancy
------------------------

There is little evidence on the safety of paint fumes during pregnancy, so it’s best to avoid being around them if possible.

If you do paint:

*   avoid solvent-based paint or spray paint, as they contain solvents
*   avoid stripping old paintwork as it may contain traces of lead

Solvents and lead can be harmful.

Saunas, hot tubs and steam rooms in pregnancy
---------------------------------------------

Little is known about the safety of saunas, hot tubs and steam rooms in pregnancy.

You may choose to avoid them because of the risks of overheating, dehydration and fainting, particularly in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

Published Time: 1 Dec 2020, 5:08 p.m.

Markdown Content:
This page lists the benefits you're entitled to when you're pregnant, and has information on maternity, paternity and shared parental leave.

It also lists other benefits you might be able to receive, depending on your circumstances.

Leave and time off
------------------

When you're pregnant, you're entitled to up to a year of maternity leave.

### Statutory Maternity Leave

If you are employed and pregnant, you are entitled to 52 weeks (1 year) of maternity leave, no matter how long you've worked for your employer.

This is made up of 26 weeks of ordinary maternity leave and 26 weeks of additional maternity leave.

You have a range of rights during this period and can also request that your employer provides flexible working arrangements if you decide to return to work at the end of your leave.

Your employment terms (for example, your pension contributions) are protected while you're on Statutory Maternity Leave.

If you're made redundant while on Statutory Maternity Leave, you also have extra rights.

#### Further information

*   [GOV.UK: Maternity pay and leave](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave)
*   [GOV.UK: Check if you can get Maternity or Paternity Leave or Pay, or Maternity Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-paternity-pay-leave)

### Working when pregnant

If you're pregnant, your employer must protect your health and safety, and you may have the right to paid time off for [antenatal care](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/your-antenatal-care/). You're also protected against unfair treatment.

If you enjoy your work and like the people you work with, you may have mixed feelings when you go on maternity leave.

Try to make the most of these few weeks before your baby is born. It's also a good opportunity to make some new friends.

You may make new pregnant friends you want to keep in touch with at antenatal classes, or you may get to know more people living close by.

#### Further information

*   [GOV.UK: Employee rights when taking maternity and other types of parental leave](https://www.gov.uk/employee-rights-when-on-leave)

### Planning childcare

You may have decided that you're going to spend some time at home with your baby, or you may be planning to return to work, either full time or part time, fairly soon after the birth.

If you plan to go back to work, start thinking in advance about who will look after your baby.

It's not always easy to make childcare arrangements, and it may take you some time.

You may have a relative who's willing to look after your child. If not, contact the Family Information Service at your local authority for a list of registered childminders and nurseries in your area.

You may also want to think about organising care in your own home, either on your own or sharing with other parents.

Care in your own home does not need to be registered, but make sure your carer is experienced and trained to care for babies.

#### Further information

*   [GOV.UK: Childcare you can get help paying for](https://www.gov.uk/help-with-childcare-costs)

### Returning to work after Statutory Maternity Leave

You have employment rights and responsibilities when you go back to work.

Make sure you know what these are and what to do if you have any problems or you're denied your rights.

### Requesting flexible working

All employees are entitled to request a flexible working pattern.

#### Further information

*   [GOV.UK: Flexible working](https://www.gov.uk/flexible-working)

### Paternity Leave

If you're a father-to-be or the partner of someone who is pregnant (or who is adopting or having a baby through surrogacy) – including same-sex partner – you could have the right to paternity leave.

You may be eligible for:

*   1 or 2 weeks' paid Paternity Leave
*   Paternity Pay
*   Shared Parental Leave and Pay

#### Further information

*   [GOV.UK: Paternity pay and leave](https://www.gov.uk/paternity-pay-leave)
*   [GOV.UK: Check if you can get Maternity or Paternity Leave or Pay, or Maternity Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-paternity-pay-leave)

### Shared Parental Leave

You may be eligible to share parental leave and pay with your partner.

Shared Parental Leave is designed to give parents the flexibility to decide when to return to work and allow families to spend time together in the early stages of a child's life.

*   Leave and pay can be shared following the first 2 weeks after your baby's birth. This means up to 50 weeks of leave and 37 weeks of pay can be shared.
*   You can take all of your Shared Parental Leave in one go, or you can take it in blocks separated by periods of work in between.
*   Shared Parental Leave can be taken by both parents at the same time so you and your partner can spend time at home together with your baby.

#### Further information

*   [GOV.UK: Shared Parental Leave and Pay](https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay)

Benefits if you're pregnant
---------------------------

There are benefits and financial help if you're pregnant, whether you're employed or not.

### Free NHS prescriptions and dental care

If you're pregnant or you've had a baby in the past 12 months, you're entitled to:

*   free NHS prescriptions, if you have a valid maternity exemption (MATEX) certificate
*   free NHS dental treatment, if you have a valid MATEX certificate, MatB1 certificate, notification of birth form or birth certificate – the treatments needs to have started while you were pregnant or within 12 months of your baby's birth

If you have a miscarriage or stillbirth you can continue to use your MATEX for free NHS prescriptions and free NHS dental treatment until it expires. You can also use a stillbirth certificate to get free NHS dental treatment for 12 months after your due date.

To claim free NHS prescriptions, ask a healthcare professional, for example, a doctor, nurse, midwife or health visitor. They will help you make a paper or digital application.

With a digital application, you'll get your certificate by email straight away. Otherwise, you'll get a paper MATEX certificate in the post.

The MATEX certificate lasts for 12 months after your due date. If your baby is born early, you can continue to use the certificate until it expires. If your baby is born late, you can apply for an extension.

If you apply after your baby is born, your exemption certificate will last for 12 months after the date of your baby's birth.

Title: Pregnant with twins

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/finding-out/pregnant-with-twins/

Published Time: 1 Dec 2020, 5:07 p.m.

Markdown Content:
**Fertility treatments and the fact pregnancies are happening later in life has made multiple births more common.**

Different types of twins
------------------------

One-third of all twins will be identical and two-thirds non-identical.

Identical twins
---------------

Identical (monozygotic) twins happen when a single egg (zygote) is fertilised.

The egg then divides in 2, creating identical twins who share the same genes.

Identical twins are always the same sex, so if your twins are identical, you'll have 2 girls or 2 boys.

Non-identical twins
-------------------

Non-identical (dizygotic) twins happen when 2 separate eggs are fertilised and then implant into the womb (uterus).

These non-identical twins are no more alike than any other 2 siblings.

Non-identical twins are more common. The babies may be of the same sex or different sexes.

Are you carrying twins?
-----------------------

You might think you're carrying more than 1 baby if:

*   you seem bigger than you should be for your dates
*   twins run in your family
*   you have had fertility treatment

It's usually possible to find out if you're having twins through your [12-week scan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/12-week-scan/).

At the scan, you should be told whether the babies share a placenta (meaning they're identical) or if they have 2 separate placentas (meaning they can be identical or not).

If this is not clear from the first scan, you should be offered another one.

What causes twins?
------------------

Nobody knows what causes identical (monozygotic) twins. Everyone has the same chance of having identical twins: about 1 in 250.

Identical twins do not run in families. But there are some factors that make having non-identical twins more likely:

*   non-identical twins are more common in some ethnic groups, with the highest rate among Nigerians and the lowest among Japanese
*   if you’re pregnant and over 35 you’re more likely to have non-identical twins because you’re more likely to release more than 1 egg during ovulation
*   non-identical twins run on the mother's side of the family, probably because of an inherited tendency to release more than 1 egg

[IVF](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ivf/) can increase the chance of twins, as more than 1 embryo may be transferred.

How can I tell if my twins are identical?
-----------------------------------------

The most accurate way to tell if twins are identical is through a DNA test. This can only be done after your babies are born.

The placenta could also provide clues. If your first ultrasound scan is done before 14 weeks, it should be possible to tell accurately what kind of placenta your twins have.

Otherwise, the placenta can be examined after your babies are born.

For more information on this and birth options, read about [giving birth to twins or more](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/giving-birth-to-twins-or-more/).

Read more about the [different types of twins on the Twins Trust website](https://twinstrust.org/let-us-help/pregnancy-and-birth/finding-out.html).

More detailed information on DNA testing and how to find out whether twins or triplets are identical is available on the [Multiple Births Foundation website](http://www.multiplebirths.org.uk/).
