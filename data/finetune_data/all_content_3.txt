Antenatal care is the care you get from health professionals during your pregnancy.

It's sometimes called pregnancy care or maternity care.

You'll be offered appointments with a midwife, or sometimes a doctor who specialises in pregnancy and birth (an obstetrician).

You should start your antenatal care as soon as possible once you know you're pregnant. You can do this by contacting a midwife or GP, or referring yourself directly to maternity services near you. This is usually done by filling in an online form on your local hospital or NHS trust website.

What is antenatal care?
-----------------------

This is the care you receive while you're pregnant to make sure you and your baby are as well as possible.

The midwife or doctor providing your antenatal care will:

*   check the health of you and your baby
*   give you useful information to help you have a healthy pregnancy, including advice about [healthy eating](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/have-a-healthy-diet/) and [exercise](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/exercise/)
*   discuss your options and choices for your care during pregnancy, labour and birth
*   answer any questions you may have

If you’re pregnant in England you will be offered:

*   2 [pregnancy ultrasound scans](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/ultrasound-scans/) at 11 to 14 weeks and 18 to 21 weeks
*   [antenatal screening tests](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/screening-for-downs-edwards-pataus-syndrome/) to find out the chance of your baby having certain conditions, such as Down's syndrome
*   [blood tests to check for syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/screening-for-hepatitis-b-hiv-and-syphilis/)
*   [screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/screening-for-sickle-cell-and-thalassaemia/)

You may also be offered [antenatal classes](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/antenatal-classes/), including breastfeeding workshops.

Ask your midwife about classes in your area.

Starting antenatal care
-----------------------

You can book an appointment with your GP or directly with a midwife as soon as you find out you're pregnant. You may be advised to refer yourself to your local maternity service to book your first appointment.

You can ask to be referred to your nearest midwifery service by your GP, midwife, healthcare professional, school nurse, community centre, children's centre or refugee hostel.

You can find your nearest children's centre through [your local council](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council).

It's best to see a midwife or GP as early as possible to get the information you need about having a healthy pregnancy.

Some tests, such as [screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/screening-for-sickle-cell-and-thalassaemia/), should be done before you're 10 weeks pregnant.

If you have special health needs, your midwife, GP or obstetrician may take shared responsibility for your maternity care.

This means they'll all be involved in your care during pregnancy.

Let your midwife know if you have a disability that means you have special requirements for your antenatal appointments or for labour.

If you do not speak English, tell your midwife.

How many antenatal appointments will I have?
--------------------------------------------

If you're expecting your first child, you'll have up to 10 antenatal appointments.

If you have had a baby before, you'll have around 7 appointments, but sometimes you may have more – for example, if you develop a medical condition.

Early in your pregnancy, your midwife or doctor will give you written information about how many appointments you're likely to have and when they'll happen.

You should have a chance to discuss the [schedule of antenatal appointments](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/your-antenatal-appointments/) with them.

If you cannot keep an appointment, let the clinic or midwife know and rearrange it.

Where will I have my antenatal appointments?
--------------------------------------------

Your appointments can take place at:

*   your home
*   a Children's Centre
*   a GP surgery
*   a hospital

You'll usually go to the hospital for your pregnancy scans.

Antenatal appointments should take place in a setting where you feel able to discuss sensitive issues, such as domestic abuse, sexual abuse, mental health problems or drugs.

To make sure you get the best pregnancy care, your midwife will ask you many questions about your and your family's health, and your preferences.

Your midwife will carry out some [antenatal checks and tests](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/antenatal-checks-and-tests/), some of which will be done throughout your pregnancy, such as urine tests and blood pressure checks.

The results may affect your choices later in pregnancy, so it's important not to miss them.

Your midwife will also ask about any other social care support you may have or need, such as support from social workers or family liaison officers.

Questions you might be asked
----------------------------

The midwife or doctor might ask about:

*   the date of the first day of your last period
*   your health
*   any previous illnesses and operations you have had
*   any previous pregnancies and [miscarriages](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/miscarriage/)
*   the ethnic origins of you and your partner to find out whether your baby may be at risk of certain inherited conditions
*   whether your family has a history of twins
*   your job, your partner's job and what kind of accommodation you live in to see whether your circumstances might affect your pregnancy
*   how you're feeling and whether you have been depressed

Your antenatal appointments are an opportunity to tell your midwife or doctor if you're in a vulnerable situation or if you need extra support.

This could be because of [domestic abuse or violence](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/support/domestic-abuse-in-pregnancy/), sexual abuse or [female genital mutilation](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/female-genital-mutilation-fgm/).

Antenatal appointments after 24 weeks
-------------------------------------

From around [24 weeks of your pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/week-by-week/13-to-27/24-weeks/), your antenatal appointments will usually become more frequent.

But if your pregnancy is uncomplicated and you're in good health, you may not be seen as often as someone who needs to be more closely monitored.

Later visits are usually quite short and may last 20 to 30 minutes.

Your midwife or doctor will:

*   check your urine and blood pressure
*   feel your tummy (abdomen) to check the baby's position
*   measure your womb (uterus) to check your baby's growth
*   listen to your baby's heartbeat, if you want them to

You can also ask questions or talk about anything that's worrying you.

Talking about your feelings is as important as all the antenatal tests and examinations.

You should be given information about:

*   making [your birth plan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/how-to-make-a-birth-plan/)
*   preparing for labour and birth
*   how to tell if you're in active labour
*   [induction of labour](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/inducing-labour/) if your baby is overdue (after your expected date of delivery)
*   [feeling depressed after childbirth](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/support-and-services/feeling-depressed-after-childbirth/) – such as the "baby blues" and postnatal depression
*   feeding your baby
*   vitamin K (given to prevent vitamin K deficiency bleeding in your baby)
*   screening tests for newborn babies
*   looking after yourself and your new baby

[Find out about your schedule of antenatal appointments and what to expect at each one](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/your-antenatal-appointments/)

At each antenatal appointment from 24 weeks of pregnancy, your midwife or doctor will check your baby's growth.

To do this, they'll measure the distance from the top of your womb to your pubic bone.

The measurement will be recorded in your notes.

Your baby's movements
---------------------

Keep track of your baby's movements.

If you have not felt any movement by the time you are 24 weeks pregnant, contact your midwife who will check your baby’s heartbeat.

After 24 weeks, if your baby’s movements become less frequent, slow down or stop (called reduced foetal movement), contact your midwife or doctor immediately – do not wait until the next day. Your midwife or doctor will check you and your baby and measure your bump.

You'll be offered an ultrasound scan if they have any concerns about how your baby is growing and developing.

Find out more about [your baby's movements in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/your-babys-movements/).

Your maternity notes
--------------------

At your booking appointment, your midwife will record your details and add to them at each appointment. These are your maternity notes.

Your maternity notes may be in a record book, sometimes called handheld notes. You’ll take your maternity notes home and be asked to bring them to all your antenatal appointments. Take your notes with you wherever you go in case you need medical attention while you’re away from home.

Your maternity notes may be electronic, which you will be able to access digitally.

You can ask your maternity team to explain anything in your notes that you do not understand.

Planning ahead for your appointments
------------------------------------

Waiting times in clinics can vary and having to wait a long time for an appointment can be particularly difficult if you have young children with you.

Planning ahead can make your visits easier.

Here are some suggestions:

*   write a list of any questions you want to ask and take it with you
*   make sure you get answers to your questions or the chance to discuss any worries
*   if your partner is free, they may be able to go with you – this can help them feel more involved in the pregnancy
*   you can buy refreshments in some clinics – take a snack with you if you cannot buy one at the clinic

The [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) antenatal care guidelines](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG62) give useful information on the timing of visits during pregnancy and a description of what will happen each time.

You'll have a number of antenatal appointments during your pregnancy, and you'll see a midwife or sometimes an obstetrician (doctor specialising in pregnancy).

They'll check the health of you and your baby, give you useful information and answer any questions.

Pregnant employees have the right to paid time off for antenatal care.

This page lists the appointments you'll be offered and when you should have them.

If you're pregnant with your first baby, you'll have more appointments than those already with children.

First contact with midwife or doctor
------------------------------------

Contact a GP or midwife as soon as possible after you find out that you're pregnant.

They should give you information about:

*   folic acid supplements
*   nutrition, diet and food hygiene
*   lifestyle factors – such as smoking, drinking and recreational drug use
*   antenatal screening tests 

You should be told about the risks, benefits and limits of these tests.

Screening for sickle cell disease and thalassaemia should be offered before 10 weeks.

This is so you can find out about all your options and make an informed decision if your baby has a chance of inheriting these conditions.

It's important to tell your midwife or doctor if:

*   there were any complications or infections in a previous pregnancy or delivery, such as pre-eclampsia or premature birth
*   you're being treated for a long-term condition, such as diabetes or high blood pressure
*   you or anyone in your family has previously had a baby with a health condition (for example, spina bifida)
*   there's a family history of an inherited condition (for example, sickle cell or cystic fibrosis)
*   you know that you're a genetic carrier of an inherited condition such as sickle cell or thalassaemia – you should also tell the midwife if you know the baby's biological father is a genetic carrier of these conditions
*   you have had [fertility treatment](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ivf/) and either a donor egg or donor sperm

8 to 12 weeks: booking appointment
----------------------------------

It's best to see your midwife or doctor as early as possible to get the information you need to have a healthy pregnancy.

*   plan the care you'll get throughout your pregnancy
*   identify any potential risks associated with any work you may do
*   measure your height and weight, and calculate your [body mass index (BMI)](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/lifestyle/what-is-the-body-mass-index-bmi/)
*   measure your blood pressure and test your urine for protein
*   find out whether you're at increased risk of gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia
*   offer you screening tests and make sure you understand what's involved before you decide to have any of them
*   offer you an [ultrasound scan](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ultrasound-scan/) at 11 to 14 weeks to estimate when your baby is due
*   offer you an ultrasound scan at 18 to 21 weeks to check the physical development of your baby and look for 11 rare conditions
*   ask about your mood to assess [your mental health](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/mental-health/)
*   ask about any past or present severe mental illness or psychiatric treatment

This appointment is an opportunity to tell your midwife or doctor if you're in a vulnerable situation or if you need extra support.

This could be because of domestic abuse or violence, sexual abuse or [female genital mutilation (FGM)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/female-genital-mutilation-fgm/).

FGM can cause problems during labour and childbirth, which can be life threatening for you and your baby.

It's important you tell your midwife or doctor if this has happened to you.

Published Time: 8 Dec 2020, 3:58 p.m.

Markdown Content:
While you're pregnant, you'll normally see a small number of healthcare professionals.

They want to make you feel as comfortable as possible while you're pregnant and when you have your baby.

You'll usually have the same midwife or a small team of midwives who will care for you during pregnancy and the birth of your baby. But in some cases you may see several different professionals. You can ask what's available in your area.

At each appointment, the professionals you see should introduce themselves and explain what they do. If they forget, ask them. Make a note of who you've seen and what they've said in case you need to discuss something later on.

This page lists the people you're most likely to meet. Some may have trainee students with them – you'll be asked if you mind the students being present.

Midwife
-------

A midwife is an expert in normal pregnancy and birth.

Midwives are specially trained to care for mothers and babies throughout normal pregnancy, [labour](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/) and after the birth. They provide care in hospital or at home.

Midwives sometimes work both in hospitals and in the community (GP surgeries and home visits) so the same midwife may be able to provide [antenatal care](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/your-antenatal-care/) and be present at the birth.

The name of the midwife or team of midwives responsible for your care will be in your pregnancy notes.

Find out more about things to talk about with your midwife when [making your birth plan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/how-to-make-a-birth-plan/).

A midwife will look after you during labour if everything is straightforward, and they'll probably deliver your baby.

If any complications develop during your pregnancy or delivery, you'll see a doctor as well as being cared for by your midwife.

After the birth, you and your baby will be cared for by midwives or maternity support workers.

Head of midwifery
-----------------

The head of midwifery can support you if you're having problems with your care or you feel your wishes are not being considered.

The charity [Birthrights has factsheets on your rights and the law in pregnancy and birth](https://www.birthrights.org.uk/factsheets/) that you might find useful.

If you've had your baby and want to talk about your birth experience, even if this was some time ago, the head of midwifery will be able to arrange this for you. The hospital's website may also have contact details for this service.

Obstetrician
------------

An obstetrician is a doctor who specialises in care during pregnancy, labour and after birth.

Your midwife or GP will refer you to an obstetrician if they have any concerns about your pregnancy – for example, you had a previous complication in pregnancy or have a long-term illness.

You can ask to see an obstetrician if you have any concerns you want to discuss.

Anaesthetist
------------

An anaesthetist is a doctor who specialises in providing pain relief and anaesthesia.

If you decide to have an [epidural](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidural/) for pain relief during labour, it'll be given by an anaesthetist.

If you require a [caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/), an anaesthetist will provide the appropriate anaesthesia.

They'll also be present if you require an epidural for an [instrumental delivery](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/forceps-or-vacuum-delivery/) – for example, with forceps or a vacuum device that helps deliver the baby's head (ventouse).

Paediatrician
-------------

A paediatrician is a doctor specialising in the care of babies and children.

A paediatrician may check your baby after the birth to make sure everything is OK, and they'll be present when your baby is born if you've had a difficult labour.

If your baby has any problems, you'll be able to discuss these with the paediatrician.

If your baby is born at home or your hospital stay is short, you may not see a paediatrician at all. Your midwife or GP can check on you and your baby.

Neonatal nurse
--------------

Neonatal nurses are specially trained to care for babies who are premature or unwell when they're born.

They usually work within specialist neonatal units in the hospital or in the community.

They also have an important role in providing support for parents whose babies need neonatal care.

Sonographer
-----------

A sonographer is trained to carry out [ultrasound scans](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/ultrasound-scans/).

A sonographer will perform your:

*   [12-week scan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/12-week-scan/) (dating scan)
*   [20-week scan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/20-week-scan/)
*   [screening test for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/screening-for-downs-edwards-pataus-syndrome/)

You may be scanned at other times in your pregnancy.

Obstetric physiotherapist
-------------------------

An obstetric physiotherapist is trained to help you cope with physical changes during and after pregnancy and childbirth.

Some go to [antenatal classes](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/antenatal-classes/) and teach antenatal exercises, relaxation and breathing, active birth positions, and other ways to keep yourself fit and healthy during pregnancy and labour.

After the birth, they advise on postnatal exercises to tone up your muscles.

Health visitor
--------------

Health visitors are trained nurses who support and educate families from pregnancy through to a child's 5th birthday.

You may meet your health visitor before the birth of your baby and in the first few weeks after the birth.

You may continue to see your health visitor or a member of the team at home, or at your child health clinic, children's centre, health centre or GP surgery.

[GOV.UK: find a children's centre near you](https://www.gov.uk/find-sure-start-childrens-centre)

Dietitian
---------

If you have any concerns about special diets or eating healthily – for example, if you develop [gestational diabetes](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gestational-diabetes/) – a dietitian can give you the advice you need.

Title: Antenatal care with twins

When you're expecting twins or triplets, it's important that you attend all your appointments because of the increased risks with this type of pregnancy.

Your antenatal team should be experienced in caring for women having twins or triplets.

Check-ups and scans in a twin pregnancy
---------------------------------------

The number of tests and scans you'll be offered will depend on the type of twins or triplets you're having.

Women with multiple pregnancies should be offered an ultrasound scan at around 11 to 14 weeks. It's important to attend this appointment.

This is the best time to find out what type of placenta and membranes your twins have (chorionicity) and check your dates.

You can also have a nuchal translucency test for Down's syndrome done at the same time if you wish.

[Find out more about screening for Down's syndrome](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/screening-for-downs-edwards-pataus-syndrome/)

Between 16 and 20 weeks, you should be offered a cervical length scan, which helps to assess your risk of giving birth prematurely. If the scan finds that you have a short cervix, you may be offered progesterone tablets to take once a day until 34 weeks.

You'll also be offered a scan, called an anomaly scan, at 20 weeks to check that your babies are developing normally.

Different types of twins
------------------------

For medical purposes, there are 3 types of twins. These apply to triplets too, although a triplet pregnancy will be more complex than a twin one.

The 3 types are:

*   dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twins – each has their own separate placenta and separate sac
*   monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins – share a single placenta but have their own separate sacs
*   monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA) twins – share both a placenta and a sac – this is a much rarer type of pregnancy

All non-identical twins are DCDA.

Most identical twins are MCDA, but some will be DCDA. Very rarely identical twins can be MCMA.

What extra care may I need?
---------------------------

If your babies are MCDA, you can expect more scans and monitoring, as this type of twins has the highest risk of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which is an abnormality of the placenta.

You may be referred to a regional centre for foetal medicine to be seen by a specialist doctor.

If your babies are MCMA, you'll also have frequent scans. With this type of twins there's often some cord entanglement, which can cause complications.

These types of twins are rare, and you can expect to receive specialist care and close monitoring.

If your babies are DCDA, the risks to their health in the womb are much lower. You'll usually be scanned every 4 weeks.

It's important to attend all your appointments so any problems can be picked up early and treated if necessary.

Risks in twin pregnancies
-------------------------

While most multiple pregnancies are healthy and result in healthy babies, there are more risks to be aware of when you're pregnant with 2 or more babies.

If you're pregnant with more than 1 baby, you're at higher risk of pregnancy complications, such as [iron deficiency anaemia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/iron-deficiency-anaemia/) and [pre-eclampsia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/).

Make sure you go to all your antenatal appointments so any problems can be picked up early and treated if necessary.

### Premature birth

Twins and triplets have a higher risk of being born prematurely (before 37 weeks) and having a low birthweight. Your risk is also increased if you've given birth prematurely before, or if a cervical length scan found that you have a short cervix.

Most twins and triplets are born prematurely.

Around 6 in 10 twins are born before 37 weeks. Almost 8 in 10 triplets are born before 35 weeks.

### Planned birth

If you are expecting twins or triplets, you will be offered a planned birth at:

*   37 weeks for twins with a placenta each
*   36 weeks for identical twins sharing a placenta
*   35 weeks for an uncomplicated triplet pregnancy
*   32-33 weeks for MCMA twins

It can be dangerous for twin and triplet pregnancies to carry on after the planned birth dates. Plans for the birth will be discussed with you taking into account your needs and preferences.

If you turn down the offer of a planned birth, you will be offered weekly appointments with an obstetrician and weekly ultrasound scans plus a foetal growth scan every 2 weeks.

Your obstetric team will work closely with you throughout your pregnancy and after your babies are born to help make sure you and your babies are safe and healthy.

### Twin-twin transfusion syndrome

Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) affects identical twins who share a placenta (monochorionic).

The risk is higher for MCDA twins, but it can happen in MCMA twins, too.

It's caused by abnormal connecting blood vessels in the twins' placenta.

This results in an imbalanced blood flow from 1 twin (known as the donor) to the other (recipient), leaving 1 baby with a greater blood volume than the other.

TTTS affects 10 to 15% of monochorionic twins and can have serious consequences.

You'll need to discuss your individual case with a doctor, as what works in one TTTS pregnancy may not be appropriate in another.

Markdown Content:
During your pregnancy, you'll be offered a range of tests, including blood tests and [ultrasound baby scans](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/ultrasound-scans/).

These are designed to:

*   help make your pregnancy safer
*   check and assess the development and wellbeing of you and your baby
*   screen for particular conditions

You do not have to have any of the tests – it's your choice. However, it's important to understand the purpose of all tests so you can make an informed decision about whether to have them. You can discuss this with your maternity team.

Weight and height checks in pregnancy
-------------------------------------

You'll be weighed at your booking appointment, but you will not be weighed regularly during your pregnancy. Your height and weight are used to calculate your body mass index (BMI).

If you are overweight you have an increased risk of problems during pregnancy.

[Find out more about being overweight when you get pregnant](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/existing-health-conditions/overweight/)

You're likely to put on 10 to 12.5kg (22 to 28lb) in pregnancy after being [20 weeks pregnant](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/week-by-week/13-to-27/20-weeks/). Much of the extra weight is because the baby is growing, but your body also stores fat for making breast milk after birth.

Talk to a GP or midwife if you are concerned about your weight.

It's important to [have a healthy diet in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/have-a-healthy-diet/) and do [regular exercise](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/exercise/) during your pregnancy.

Antenatal urine tests
---------------------

You'll be asked to give a urine sample at your antenatal appointments. Your urine is checked for several things, including protein.

If this is found in your urine, it may mean you have a urine infection. It may also be a sign of [pre-eclampsia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/).

Blood pressure tests in pregnancy
---------------------------------

Your blood pressure will be checked at every antenatal visit. A rise in blood pressure later in pregnancy could be a sign of pre-eclampsia.

It's very common for your blood pressure to be lower in the middle of your pregnancy than at other times. This is not a problem, but it may make you feel lightheaded if you get up quickly. Talk to your midwife if you're concerned about it.

[Find out more about high blood pressure and pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/complications/high-blood-pressure/)

Blood tests and scans in pregnancy
----------------------------------

As part of your antenatal care, you'll be offered several blood tests and scans. Some are offered to everyone, while others are only offered if you might be at risk of a particular infection or condition.

All the tests are done to make your pregnancy safer or check that the baby is healthy, but you do not have to have them if you do not want to.

[For more information visit our page about screening tests in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/screening-for-hepatitis-b-hiv-and-syphilis/)

Blood group and rhesus status
-----------------------------

You will be offered a blood test to tell you whether you are blood group rhesus negative or rhesus positive. If you are rhesus negative you may need extra care to reduce the risk of [rhesus disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/rhesus-disease/).

Rhesus disease can happen if you are rhesus negative and pregnant and involves your body developing antibodies that attack the baby's blood cells. This can lead to anaemia and jaundice in the baby.

If you are rhesus negative, you may be offered injections during pregnancy to prevent you from producing these antibodies. This is safe for both mother and baby.

Iron deficiency anaemia
-----------------------

[Iron deficiency anaemia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/iron-deficiency-anaemia/) makes you tired and less able to cope with loss of blood when you give birth.

You should be offered screening for iron deficiency anaemia at your booking appointment and at 28 weeks.

If tests show you have iron deficiency anaemia, you'll probably be offered iron and folic acid.

Gestational diabetes
--------------------

You may be at higher risk of developing diabetes in pregnancy (gestational diabetes) if you:

*   are overweight
*   have had diabetes in pregnancy before
*   have had a baby weighing 4.5kg (9.9lb) or more before
*   have a close relative with diabetes
*   have a south Asian, black or African Caribbean, or Middle Eastern family background

If you're considered to be at high risk for gestational diabetes, you may be offered a test called the OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test). This involves drinking a sugary drink and having blood tests.

The OGTT is done when you're between 24 and 28 weeks pregnant. If you've had gestational diabetes before, you'll be offered:

*   early self monitoring of blood glucose levels, or
*   an OGTT earlier in pregnancy, soon after your booking visit, and another at 24 to 28 weeks if the first test is normal

Markdown Content:
If you're pregnant in England you'll be offered an ultrasound scan at around 10 to 14 weeks of pregnancy. This is called the dating scan. It's used to see how far along in your pregnancy you are and check your baby's development. The scan may also be part of a screening test for Down's syndrome.

Your midwife or doctor will book you a dating scan appointment. It will usually take place at your local hospital ultrasound department. Most scans are carried out by sonographers.

You may need to have a full bladder for this scan, as this makes the ultrasound image clearer. You can ask your midwife or doctor before the scan if this is the case. The dating scan usually takes about 20 minutes.

Why the 20-week scan is done
----------------------------

The 20-week scan is done to check if your baby could have a condition that affects their health and development.

Your baby will be checked for signs of 11 different conditions as part of the scan.

Some conditions can be seen more clearly than others, so the scan may not find everything. But screening is the best way to find any conditions, and help you and your doctors make the best decisions for you and your baby.

Your placenta and the blood flow in your uterus will also be checked.

Show the 11 conditions the scan checks for

During the 20-week scan your baby will be checked for signs of:

*   anencephaly
*   open spina bifida
*   cleft lip and palate
*   diaphragmatic hernia
*   gastroschisis
*   exomphalos
*   serious cardiac abnormalities
*   bilateral renal agenesis
*   severe skeletal dysplasia
*   Edwards' syndrome, or Trisomy 18
*   Patau's syndrome, or Trisomy 13

[Find out more about the conditions checked for during the fetal anomaly (20-week) scan on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/fetal-anomalies-screening-conditions-diagnosis-treatment)

Who the 20-week scan is for
---------------------------

A 20-week scan is always offered when you're pregnant. It's usually done when you're between 18 and 21 weeks pregnant.

How to get the 20-week scan
---------------------------

Your midwife will tell you how to book the 20-week scan. How you book depends on which area of the country you are in.

You may:

*   be given a form to fill in after [your first midwife appointment](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/finding-out/your-first-midwife-appointment/)
*   need to book the appointment after your 12-week scan
*   need to call your local hospital to book the scan
*   get a letter in the post with a prebooked appointment
*   need to book the appointment using an app

You'll usually have the scan before you're 21 weeks pregnant, but you're able to have it up until you're 23 weeks pregnant in some cases.

You'll also be told if you need to have a full bladder before the scan.

Information:

If you've not had a 20-week scan and you're between 18 and 23 weeks pregnant, tell your midwife or GP.

It's your choice if you want to have a 20-week scan or not. The scan is the best way to find out if your baby has one of the 11 conditions, but not everyone wants this information. Talk to your midwife about your options.

If you decide not to have it but change your mind later, speak to your midwife or GP. They can tell you if you're still able to have the scan.

Preparing for the 20-week scan
------------------------------

There are things you can do to prepare for your 20-week scan.

### Do

*   arrive for your appointment early
    
*   wear loose clothing that's easy to move to get to your tummy
    
*   take out a belly piercing, if you have one
    
*   bring your maternity notes with you, if you have paper notes
    
*   make sure you have a full bladder before the scan, if you've been told to
    
*   check with the hospital or clinic before your appointment if you'll need to pay for pictures of your baby
    

### Important

You can bring someone to the scan with you, but most hospitals do not allow children. Check with the clinic or hospital before your appointment.

How the 20-week scan is done
----------------------------

Your 20-week scan is usually done at a local hospital, clinic or health centre by a trained healthcare professional.

The [ultrasound scan](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ultrasound-scan/) usually takes around 30 minutes. There's no known risk to you, or your baby, from the scan.

The scan can sometimes take longer if your baby is moving around a lot or is not in the right position to get clear pictures.

If this happens, you may be asked to go for a walk or eat something before coming back after a short break so all the checks can be done.

If it's still difficult to get clear pictures of your baby, you'll be offered another appointment before you're 23 weeks pregnant.

The scan cannot find all conditions. If you have any symptoms you're worried about or something does not feel right, it's important to tell your midwife.

### During the scan

![Image 1: A healthcare professional holding a scanner on the tummy of a pregnant woman with white skin. An ultrasound image of a baby is visible on a screen.](https://assets.nhs.uk/nhsuk-cms/images/A_1017_Anomaly-scan_AMDYKF.width-320_S8lvs6z.jpg)

1.  The ultrasound scan will take place in a dimly lit room to get clear pictures of your baby.
2.  You'll be asked to lie on a couch and to lift or lower your clothing so the healthcare professional can see and touch your tummy.
3.  Tissue paper will be tucked into your clothing before a cold gel is put on your tummy.
4.  The healthcare professional will move a handheld device called a probe over your tummy so they can see a picture of your baby and check their body. This may be uncomfortable.
5.  They may be quiet while they look closely at your baby's bones, heart, brain, spinal cord, face, kidneys and tummy. They'll also check your placenta and the blood flow in your uterus.
6.  Sometimes the healthcare professional may ask another member of the team to check the picture of your baby.
7.  You may be asked if you'd like to know the sex of your baby.

Getting the results of your 20-week scan
----------------------------------------

You'll be told the results of the 20-week scan after the healthcare professional has done all the checks.

Most people will be told their baby does not have any signs of a condition.

But some people may be told their baby has signs of one of the conditions being checked for.

### If your baby has signs of a condition

You'll be told if there are signs your baby may have a health condition after the scan.

If the ultrasound scan finds something, you may be offered more scans and tests, such as [amniocentesis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/amniocentesis/) or [chorionic villus sampling](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chorionic-villus-sampling-cvs/).

You'll be referred to a specialist, who will tell you more about the tests to help you decide if you want to have them.

These tests will be able to tell you if your baby definitely has a health condition and what this means for you and your baby.

Published Time: 3 Dec 2020, 9:33 a.m.

Markdown Content:
Ultrasound scans use sound waves to build a picture of the baby in the womb. The scans are painless, have no known side effects on mothers or babies, and can be carried out at any stage of pregnancy. Talk to your midwife, GP or obstetrician about any concerns you have.

Having a scan in pregnancy is usually a happy event, but be aware that ultrasound scans may detect some serious health conditions. It's your choice whether to have screening. Your midwife can discuss your options with you.

See [If antenatal screening tests find something](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/if-antenatal-screening-tests-find-something/) for more information on if a scan or other screening test suggests your baby may be more likely to have a condition.

What will happen at the scan?
-----------------------------

Most scans are carried out by sonographers. The scan is carried out in a dimly lit room so the sonographer is able to get good images of your baby.

You'll be asked to lie on your back and reveal your tummy.

The sonographer will put ultrasound gel on your tummy, which makes sure there is good contact between the machine and your skin.

The sonographer passes a probe over your tummy and a picture of the baby will appear on the ultrasound screen.

During the exam, sonographers need to keep the screen in a position that gives them a good view of the baby.

The sonographer will carefully examine your baby's body. The sonographer may need to apply slight pressure on your tummy to get the best views of the baby.

How long will a scan take?
--------------------------

A scan usually takes around 20 to 30 minutes. However, the sonographer may not be able to get good views if your baby is lying in an awkward position or moving around a lot.

If it's difficult to get a good image, the scan may take longer or have to be repeated at another time.

Can an ultrasound scan harm me or my baby?
------------------------------------------

There are no known risks to the baby or the mother from having an ultrasound scan, but it's important that you consider carefully whether to have the scan or not.

This is because the scan can provide information that may mean you have to make further important decisions. For example, you may be offered further tests, such as amniocentesis, that have a risk of [miscarriage](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/miscarriage/).

When are scans offered?  
-------------------------

Hospitals in England offer at least 2 ultrasound scans during pregnancy:

*   at 11 to 14 weeks
*   and between 18 and 21 weeks

The first scan is called the [12-week scan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/12-week-scan/). The sonographer estimates when your baby is due (the estimated date of delivery, or EDD) based on the baby's measurements.

The dating scan can include a nuchal translucency (NT) scan, which is part of the combined [screening test for Down's syndrome](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/screening-for-downs-edwards-pataus-syndrome/), if you choose to have this screening.

The second scan offered during pregnancy is the [20-week screening scan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/20-week-scan/). It usually takes place between 18 and 21 weeks of pregnancy. It's sometimes called the anomaly scan or mid-pregnancy scan. This scan checks for 11 physical conditions in your baby.

You may be offered more than 2 scans, depending on your health and the pregnancy.

When will I get the results?
----------------------------

The sonographer will be able to tell you the results of the scan at the time.

Do I have to have ultrasound scans?
-----------------------------------

No, not if you do not want to. Some people want to find out if their baby is more likely to have a condition, while others do not. The 12-week dating scan and 20-week screening scan will be offered to you, but you do not have to have them.

Your choice will be respected if you decide not to have the scans, and your antenatal care will continue as normal. You'll be given the chance to discuss it with your maternity team before making your decision.

What can an ultrasound scan be used for?
----------------------------------------

An ultrasound scan can be used to:

*   check your baby's size – at the 12-week dating scan, this gives a better idea of how many [weeks pregnant](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/week-by-week/) you are; your due date, which is originally calculated from the first day of your last period, may be adjusted according to the ultrasound measurements
*   check whether you're having more than 1 baby
*   detect some physical conditions
*   show the position of your baby and the placenta – for example, when the placenta is low down in late pregnancy, a [caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/) may be advised
*   check that the baby is growing normally – this is particularly important if you're carrying twins, or you've had problems in this pregnancy or a previous pregnancy

Can I bring family or friends with me when I have the scan?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Yes. You may like someone to come with you to the scan appointment.

Most hospitals do not allow children to attend scans as childcare is not usually available. Please ask your hospital about this before your appointment.

Remember, an ultrasound scan is an important medical examination and it is treated in the same way as any other hospital investigation. Ultrasound scans can sometimes find problems with the baby.

If everything appears normal, what happens next?
------------------------------------------------

Most scans show that the baby is developing normally and no problems are found. This is because most babies are healthy. You can continue with your routine antenatal care.

Scans cannot pick up all health conditions so it's important to speak to a doctor or midwife if you're worried that something is not right.

If the scan shows your baby is more likely to have a condition, what happens next?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the scan shows your baby is more likely to have a condition, the sonographer may ask for a second opinion from another member of staff. You might be offered another test to find out for certain if your baby has the condition.

If you're offered further tests, you will be given more information about them so you can decide whether or not you want to have them. You'll be able to discuss this with your midwife or consultant.

If necessary, you will be referred to a specialist, possibly in another hospital.

Can I find out the sex of my baby?
----------------------------------

Finding out the sex of your baby is not offered as part of the national screening programme.

If you want to find out the sex of your baby, you may be able to during the 20-week screening scan but this depends on the policy of your hospital. Tell the sonographer at the start of the scan that you'd like to know your baby's sex.

Be aware, though, that it's not possible for the sonographer to be 100% certain about your baby's sex. For example, if your baby is lying in an awkward position, it may be difficult or impossible to tell.

Some hospitals have a policy of not telling patients the sex of their baby. Speak to your sonographer or midwife to find out more.

Can I have a picture of my baby?
--------------------------------

You will need to check if your hospital provides this service. If they do, there may be a charge.

Video: Screening for you and your baby
--------------------------------------

This video shows which tests are available during pregnancy and after your baby has been born.

Media review due: 14 March 2026

You can watch translated versions of this video on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/showcase/7081234).

You'll be offered some screening tests during pregnancy to try to find any health conditions that could affect you or your baby.

The tests can help you make choices about further tests and care or treatment during your pregnancy or after your baby's born. All screening tests offered by the NHS are free.

What are screening tests?
-------------------------

Screening tests are used to find people at higher chance of a health problem.

This means they can get earlier, potentially more effective, treatment or make informed decisions about their health.

Screening tests are not perfect. Some people will be told that they or their baby have a higher chance of having a health condition when in fact they do not have the condition.

Also, a few people will be told that they or their baby have a lower chance of having a health condition when in fact they do have the condition.

What do screening tests involve?
--------------------------------

The screening tests offered during pregnancy in England are either [ultrasound scans](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ultrasound-scan/) or blood tests, or a combination of both.

Ultrasound scans may detect conditions such as spina bifida.

Blood tests can show whether you have a higher chance of inherited conditions such as sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia, and whether you have infections like HIV, hepatitis B or syphilis.

Blood tests combined with scans can help find out how likely it is that the baby has Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome.

What are the risks of screening tests?
--------------------------------------

Screening tests cannot harm you or the baby but it is important to consider carefully whether or not to have these tests.

Some screening tests in pregnancy can lead to difficult decisions for you.

For example, screening tests for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome can lead to difficult decisions about whether to have a diagnostic test, such as [amniocentesis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/amniocentesis/), that carries a chance of miscarriage.

A diagnostic test tells you for certain whether you or your baby has the condition.

If diagnostic tests show your baby has a condition, this can lead to a decision about whether you want to continue or end the pregnancy.

Having a further test or ending the pregnancy will always be your decision, and healthcare professionals will support you whatever you decide.

It's up to you whether or not you choose to have screening tests in pregnancy.

When will I be offered screening?
---------------------------------

Different screening tests are offered at different times during pregnancy.

The screening test for sickle cell and thalassaemia should be offered as early as possible before 10 weeks of pregnancy.

It's recommended that screening blood tests for HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis should happen as early as possible in pregnancy.

This is so you can be offered specialist care and treatment to protect your health and reduce the chance of your baby getting infected.

These blood tests should not be delayed until the first scan appointment.

You'll be offered screening for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome around the time of your dating scan, which happens when you're around 11 to 14 weeks pregnant.

You'll be offered screening to check your baby's development at a 20-week scan when you're around 18 to 21 weeks pregnant.

Will screening tests give me a definite answer?
-----------------------------------------------

This depends what the screening tests are looking for.

### Yes

Screening tests for HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis are very accurate, and will tell for certain whether you have these infections.

If the test is positive, you'll be offered further tests and examinations by specialist doctors to find out the treatment you need.

### No

Screening for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome cannot say for certain whether your baby has the condition. It tells you if your baby has a lower or higher chance of having the condition.

If your baby has a higher chance of a condition, you'll be offered a diagnostic test that gives a more definite "yes" or "no" answer.

Screening tests for sickle cell and thalassaemia will tell you for certain whether you're a carrier or have these conditions. They will not tell you whether or not your baby has the condition.

If you or the baby's father is a carrier or has the condition, you'll be offered diagnostic tests to find out if your baby is affected.

Do I have to have screening?
----------------------------

No – it's up to you whether you have a screening test. It's a personal choice that only you can make.

You can discuss each of the screening tests you're offered with your midwife or doctor and decide whether or not it's right for you.

Some of the screening tests you'll be offered are recommended by the NHS.

These include:

*   blood tests for infectious diseases
*   eye screening if you have pre-existing diabetes (not gestational diabetes)
*   newborn screening tests

This is because the results from these tests can help make sure that you or your baby get urgent treatment for serious conditions.

Confidentiality
---------------

By law, everyone working in, or on behalf of, the NHS must respect your privacy and keep all information about you safe.

The NHS Constitution sets out how the NHS should handle your records to protect your privacy.

In addition, there are laws in place to ensure confidentiality is maintained. Screening records are only shared with staff who need to see them.

Sometimes information is used for audit research purposes to improve screening outcomes and services. Information about this will be provided when you're screened.

Some private companies also provide screening tests that you have to pay for. The NHS cannot guarantee the quality of private screening.

Published Time: 3 Dec 2020, 9:48 a.m.

Markdown Content:
You will be offered a screening test for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome between 10 and 14 weeks of pregnancy. This is to assess your chances of having a baby with one of these conditions.

Down's syndrome is also called trisomy 21 or T21. Edwards' syndrome is also called trisomy 18 or T18, and Patau's syndrome is also called trisomy 13 or T13.

If a screening test shows that you have a higher chance of having a baby with Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome, you'll be offered further tests to find out for certain if your baby has the condition.

What are Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Down's syndrome

Down's syndrome causes some level of learning disability.

People with Down's syndrome may be more likely to have other health conditions, such as heart conditions, and problems with the digestive system, hearing and vision. Sometimes these can be serious, but many can be treated.

[Read more about Down's syndrome](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/downs-syndrome/)

### Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome

Sadly, most babies with Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome will die before or shortly after birth. Some babies may survive to adulthood, but this is rare.

All babies born with Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome will have a wide range of problems, which can be very serious. These may include major complications affecting their brain.

Read more about [Edwards' syndrome](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/edwards-syndrome/) and [Patau's syndrome](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pataus-syndrome/).

What does screening for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome involve?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Combined test

A screening test for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome is available between weeks 10 and 14 of pregnancy. It's called the combined test because it combines an ultrasound scan with a blood test. The blood test can be carried out at the same time as the [12-week scan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/12-week-scan/).

If you choose to have the test, you will have a blood sample taken. At the scan, the fluid at the back of the baby's neck is measured to determine the "nuchal translucency". Your age and the information from these 2 tests are used to work out the chance of the baby having Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome.

Obtaining a nuchal translucency measurement depends on the position of the baby and is not always possible. If this is the case, you will be offered a different blood screening test, called the quadruple test, when you're 14 to 20 weeks pregnant.

### Quadruple blood screening test

If it was not possible to obtain a nuchal translucency measurement, or you're more than 14 weeks into your pregnancy, you'll be offered a test called the quadruple blood screening test between 14 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. This only screens for Down's syndrome and is not as accurate as the combined test.

### 20-week screening scan

For Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome, if you are too far into your pregnancy to have the combined test, you'll be offered a [20-week screening scan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/20-week-scan/). This looks for physical conditions, including Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome.

Can this screening test harm me or my baby?
-------------------------------------------

The screening test cannot harm you or the baby, but it's important to consider carefully whether to have this test.

It cannot tell you for certain whether the baby does or does not have Down's syndrome, Edward's syndrome or Patau's syndrome, but it can provide information that may lead to further important decisions. For example, you may be offered diagnostic tests that can tell you for certain whether the baby has these conditions, but these tests have a risk of miscarriage.

Do I need to have screening for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You do not need to have this screening test – it's your choice. Some people want to find out the chance of their baby having these conditions while others do not.

You can choose to have screening for:

*   all 3 conditions
*   Down's syndrome only
*   Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome only
*   none of the conditions

What if I decide not to have this test?
---------------------------------------

If you choose not to have the screening test for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome, you can still choose to have other tests, such as a 12-week scan.

If you choose not to have the screening test for these conditions, it's important to understand that if you have a scan at any point during your pregnancy, it could pick up physical conditions.

The person scanning you will always tell you if any conditions are found.

Getting your results
--------------------

The screening test will not tell you whether your baby does or does not have Down's, Edwards' or Patau's syndromes – it will tell you if you have a higher or lower chance of having a baby with one of these conditions.

If you have screening for all 3 conditions, you will receive 2 results: 1 for your chance of having a baby with Down's syndrome, and 1 for your joint chance of having a baby with Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome.

If your screening test returns a lower-chance result, you should be told within 2 weeks. If it shows a higher chance, you should be told within 3 working days of the result being available.

This may take a little longer if your test is sent to another hospital. It may be worth asking the midwife what happens in your area and when you can expect to get your results.

You will be offered an appointment to discuss the test results and the options you have.

The charity [Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC)](http://www.arc-uk.org/) offers lots of information about screening results and your options if you get a higher-chance result.

Possible results
----------------

### Lower-chance result

If the screening test shows that the chance of having a baby with Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome is lower than 1 in 150, this is a lower-chance result. More than 95 out of 100 screening test results will be lower chance.

A lower-chance result does not mean there's no chance at all of the baby having Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome.

### Higher-chance result

If the screening test shows that the chance of the baby having Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome is higher than 1 in 150 – that is, anywhere between 1 in 2 and 1 in 150 – this is called a higher-chance result.

Fewer than 1 in 20 results will be higher chance. This means that out of 100 pregnancies screened for Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome, fewer than 5 will have a higher-chance result.

A higher-chance result does not mean the baby definitely has Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome.

Will I need further tests?
--------------------------

If you have a lower-chance result, you will not be offered a further test.

If you have a higher-chance result, you can decide to:

*   not have any further testing
*   have a second screening test called non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) – this is a blood test, which can give you a more accurate screening result and help you to decide whether to have a diagnostic test or not
*   have a diagnostic test, such as [amniocentesis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/amniocentesis/) or [chorionic villus sampling (CVS)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chorionic-villus-sampling-cvs/) straight away – this will tell you for certain whether or not your baby has Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome, but in rare cases can cause a miscarriage

You can decide to have NIPT for:

*   all 3 conditions
*   Down's syndrome only
*   Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome only

You can also decide to have a diagnostic test after NIPT.

NIPT is completely safe and will not harm your baby.

Discuss with your healthcare professional which tests are right for you.

Whatever results you get from any of the screening or diagnostic tests, you will get care and support to help you to decide what to do next.

If you find out your unborn baby has Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you find out your baby has Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome or Patau's syndrome a specialist doctor (obstetrician) or midwife will talk to you about your options .

You can read more about [what happens if antenatal screening tests find something.](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/if-antenatal-screening-tests-find-something/)

You may decide to [continue with the pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/support/having-a-baby-that-might-be-born-with-a-condition/) and prepare for your child with the condition.

Or you may decide that you do not want to continue with the pregnancy and have a [termination.](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/support/termination-for-fetal-anomaly/)

If you are faced with this choice, you will get support from health professionals to help you make your decision.

Title: Screening for hepatitis B, HIV and syphilis

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/screening-for-hepatitis-b-hiv-and-syphilis/

Published Time: 3 Dec 2020, 9:52 a.m.

Markdown Content:
**During your pregnancy, you'll be offered a blood test for 3 infectious diseases: hepatitis B, HIV and syphilis. This is part of routine antenatal screening, which is recommended for every pregnancy.**

You will usually be offered the blood test at your booking appointment with a midwife.

The blood test needs to be done as early as possible in pregnancy, ideally by 10 weeks. This is so treatment can be started early, if you need it, to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to your baby.

If you already know you have HIV or hepatitis B, you'll need early specialist appointments to plan your care in pregnancy.

If your partner has HIV, hepatitis B or syphilis, tell your midwife as soon as possible.

Hepatitis B, HIV and syphilis can all be passed to your baby during pregnancy and birth.

Hepatitis B
-----------

[Hepatitis B](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hepatitis-b/) affects the liver and can cause immediate (acute) and long-term (chronic) illness. It's passed on in blood and other body fluids, for example through sexual contact or sharing infected needles.

If you have hepatitis B, you'll be offered specialist care.

If your baby completes a course of vaccinations in their first year, this greatly reduces their risk of developing hepatitis B.

HIV
---

[HIV](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids/) weakens the immune system, making it difficult to fight off infections.

If left untreated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome).

HIV is passed on in blood and other body fluids through sexual contact or infected needles.

HIV can be passed on to your baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding if it's not treated.

Syphilis
--------

[Syphilis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/syphilis/) is usually passed on through close contact with a syphilis sore during sex. It can also be passed on to a baby during pregnancy.

If untreated, syphilis can cause serious health problems for your baby, or cause miscarriage or stillbirth.

Syphilis is treated with antibiotics. The earlier it's treated, the lower the risk of passing it on to the baby is.

How is the test done and are there any risks?
---------------------------------------------

A blood sample is taken from your arm. There are no risks associated with this test, either for you or your baby.

Do I need to have this test?
----------------------------

It's your choice to be tested for any or all of these infections.

The tests are recommended to:

*   protect your health through early treatment and care
*   reduce any risk of passing an infection on to your baby, partner or other family members

If you test positive for hepatitis B, HIV or syphilis, your partner and other family members may be offered a test for the infection.

What if I decide not to have the blood test for any of the infectious diseases?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you decide not to have the test in early pregnancy, you'll be seen by a specialist midwife and offered screening again before you are 20 weeks pregnant. The midwife will discuss the benefits of screening for these infections.

You can ask to have a test for hepatitis B, HIV or syphilis at any time if you change your sexual partner or think you're at risk.

Your results
------------

Your midwife will usually discuss your results with you either before or at your next antenatal visit and record them in your notes.

A specialist midwife will contact you if you have tested positive for hepatitis B, HIV or syphilis. This is to arrange appointments to discuss your results and organise a referral for specialist care services.

The specialist care team will offer you further tests and examinations to fully assess your condition, and the treatment and care you'll need.

Care and treatment if you have hepatitis B, HIV or syphilis
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Hepatitis B

If you have hepatitis B, you'll receive specialist care throughout your pregnancy and after the baby is born.

Your partner and any other children you have should also be offered a test for infection, and vaccinations if needed.

To prevent the baby getting hepatitis B, they will need vaccinations at the following times:

*   within 24 hours of birth (with an injection of antibodies if required)
*   4 weeks
*   8 weeks
*   12 weeks
*   16 weeks
*   1 year, with a blood test to check if infection has been avoided

It's very important that the baby has all 6 doses of the vaccine. The doses at 8, 12 and 16 weeks will be given as part of their routine infant immunisations.

### HIV

The risk of passing HIV to the baby can be greatly reduced by:

*   specialist care and treatment
*   medicine
*   planned care for the birth
*   not breastfeeding

Your partner and any other children you have should also be offered a test.

### Syphilis

If you have syphilis, you will need urgent referral to a specialist care team. Treatment is usually a course of antibiotics.

Your care team will also offer to test your partner to see if they need treatment as well so that you do not get reinfected.

Your baby may need to be examined and given antibiotics after birth.

After your test
---------------

You can still get these infections during pregnancy, even after a negative test result. Talk to your midwife or GP if you're worried about anything.

You can catch sexually transmitted infections during pregnancy if you have unprotected sex.

You can also get HIV and hepatitis B if you inject illegal drugs and share needles.

Remember, you can ask to be tested for hepatitis B, HIV or syphilis at any time during pregnancy.

Title: Screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/screening-for-sickle-cell-and-thalassaemia/

Published Time: 3 Dec 2020, 11:31 a.m.

Markdown Content:
Sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassaemia are inherited blood disorders.

If you're a carrier of the sickle cell or thalassaemia gene, you can pass these health conditions on to your baby.

All pregnant women in England are offered a blood test to find out if they carry a gene for thalassaemia.

Those at high risk of being a sickle cell carrier are offered a test for sickle cell.

If the mother is found to be a carrier, screening is also offered to the father.

This test should be offered before you're 10 weeks pregnant. It's important the test is done early.

If you find out you're a carrier, you and your partner will have the option of further tests to know if your baby will be affected.

About sickle cell and thalassaemia
----------------------------------

Sickle cell disease and thalassaemia affect haemoglobin, a part of the blood that carries oxygen around the body.

People who have these health conditions need specialist care throughout their lives.

### Sickle cell disease

People with sickle cell:

*   can have episodes of very severe pain
*   can get serious life-threatening infections
*   are usually anaemic (their bodies have difficulty carrying oxygen)

Babies with sickle cell disease can receive early treatment, including vaccinations and antibiotics.

This, along with support from their parents, will help prevent serious illness and allow the child to live a healthier life.

[Find out more about sickle cell disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sickle-cell-disease/)

### Thalassaemia

People with thalassaemia can be affected by anaemia and some may need frequent blood transfusions, as well as injections and medicines throughout their lives.

[Find out more about thalassaemia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/thalassaemia/)

There are also other less common, and less serious, haemoglobin disorders that may be found through screening.

Why could I be offered screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia early in pregnancy?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Screening is offered to find out if you're a carrier of a gene for sickle cell or thalassaemia and therefore likely to pass it on to your baby.

Genes are the codes in our bodies for things like eye colour and blood group.

Genes work in pairs: for everything we inherit, we get 1 gene from our mother and 1 gene from our father.

People only have sickle cell disease or thalassaemia if they inherit 2 unusual haemoglobin genes: 1 from their mother and 1 from their father.

People who inherit just 1 unusual gene are known as carriers or as having a trait.

Carriers are healthy and do not have the disease.

Sickle cell carriers can experience some problems in situations where their bodies might not get enough oxygen, such as having a general anaesthetic.

All carriers can pass the unusual gene on to their children.

### **When both parents are carriers**

When both parents are carriers, each time they're expecting a child there's:

*   a 1 in 4 chance of the child not having or carrying the disease
*   a 2 in 4 chance of the child being a carrier
*   a 1 in 4 chance of the child having the disease

Anyone can be a carrier of haemoglobin disease. But it's more common among people with ancestors from Africa, the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, India, Pakistan, south and southeast Asia, and the Middle East.

Read more about being a [carrier of sickle cell disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sickle-cell-disease/) or a [carrier of thalassaemia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/thalassaemia/).

What does the screening test involve?
-------------------------------------

Screening for sickle cell and thalassaemia involves a blood test. It's best to have the test before you're 10 weeks pregnant.

This is because you'll have the option of more tests to find out whether your baby will be affected if this first test shows you're a carrier of a blood disorder.

By having the test early, you and your partner can find out about all your options and make an informed decision if your baby is at risk of inheriting a blood disorder.

All pregnant women are offered a test for thalassaemia, but not all women are automatically offered a test for sickle cell.

In areas where haemoglobin diseases are more common, all women will automatically be offered a blood test for sickle cell.

In areas where haemoglobin diseases are less common, a questionnaire is used to identify your family origins and the origins of the baby's father.

If the questionnaire shows that either you or the baby's father is at risk of being a sickle cell carrier, you'll be offered a screening test.

You can ask to have the test even if your family origins do not suggest the baby would be at high risk of a haemoglobin disease.

### **Can this screening harm me or my baby?**

No, the screening test cannot harm you or your baby, but it's important to think carefully about whether or not to have this test.

It can provide information that may mean you have to make further important decisions.

For example, you may be offered further tests that have a risk of [miscarriage](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/miscarriage/).

Do I have to have this screening test?
--------------------------------------

No, you do not have to have the screening test.

Some people want to find out if their baby could have sickle cell disease or thalassaemia, while others do not.

Getting your screening results
------------------------------

The test will tell you if you're a carrier or not, or whether you have the disease yourself.

You'll get the result of the blood test within a week. The person doing the test will discuss the arrangements for getting your results with you.

If you're found to be a carrier of sickle cell or thalassaemia, you'll be contacted by a specialist nurse or midwife counsellor for genetic counselling.

Further tests if the mother is a carrier
----------------------------------------

### **Tests to see if the father is a carrier**

If the screening test finds that you're a carrier of a haemoglobin disease, your baby's father will also be offered a blood test.

If tests show the father is not a carrier, your baby will not have sickle cell disease or thalassaemia and you will not be offered further tests in pregnancy.

But there's still a 1 in 2 chance your baby could be a carrier and pass on the unusual gene to their children.

You can discuss the implications of you or your baby being a carrier with your GP or a healthcare professional at your local sickle cell and thalassaemia centre.

[Find out more about screening for fathers on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tests-for-dads-sickle-cell-and-thalassaemia-screening)

### **Tests when both parents are carriers**

If tests show your baby's father is also a carrier, there's a 1 in 4 chance that your baby can have the disease.

You'll be offered further tests called diagnostic tests to find out if your baby is affected.

A diagnostic test will tell you:

*   if your baby has sickle cell disease, thalassaemia or another haemoglobin disorder
*   if your baby is a carrier
*   if your baby is completely unaffected

If the baby's father is not available and you have been identified as a carrier, you'll be offered a diagnostic test.

About 1 in 200 diagnostic tests result in a miscarriage. It's up to you whether or not to have the diagnostic test.

It can be a very difficult time if you're told you're at risk of having a baby with sickle cell disease or thalassaemia major. Talk to your midwife, specialist nurse or doctor about your options.

You can also get information and support from the charity [Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC)](http://www.arc-uk.org/).

ARC has a helpline you can call for information and support on 020 7713 7486.

There are 2 types of diagnostic test.

#### **Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)**

This is usually performed from 11 to 14 weeks of pregnancy.

A fine needle, usually put through the mother's tummy, is used to take a tiny sample of tissue from the placenta.

The cells from the tissue can be tested for sickle cell or thalassaemia.

[Find out more about CVS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chorionic-villus-sampling-cvs/)

#### **Amniocentesis**

This is done from 15 weeks of pregnancy.

A fine needle is passed through the mother's tummy into the uterus to collect a small sample of the fluid surrounding the baby.

The fluid contains some of the baby's cells, which can be tested for sickle cell or thalassaemia.

[Find out more about amniocentesis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/amniocentesis/)

If you find out your baby has sickle cell disease or thalassaemia
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If the result shows your baby has sickle cell disease or thalassaemia, you'll be offered an appointment with a health professional.

You'll be able to get information about the particular blood disorder the baby has inherited and talk through your choices.

Some blood disorders are more serious than others. Some women decide to continue with the pregnancy, while others decide they do not want to continue with the pregnancy and have a termination (abortion).

If you're faced with this choice, you'll get professional support to help you make a decision.

Support for parents is also available from the charity [Antenatal Results and Choices (ARC)](https://www.arc-uk.org/).

If the test shows you're a carrier, there's a chance that other members of your family could be carriers, too.

You may want to encourage them to ask for a test, especially if they're planning to have a baby.

[Find out more about if antenatal screening tests find something](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/if-antenatal-screening-tests-find-something/)

What if I decide not to have screening?
---------------------------------------

If you choose not to have the screening test during pregnancy, your baby can still have screening for sickle cell disease as part of [newborn blood spot screening](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/newborn-screening/blood-spot-test/) a few days after the birth.

Can anyone have a test for sickle cell and thalassaemia?
--------------------------------------------------------

Although testing for sickle cell and thalassaemia is only offered during pregnancy, anyone can ask their GP or local sickle cell and thalassaemia centre for a free test at any time.

If you or your partner are concerned you may be a carrier, perhaps because someone in your family has a blood disorder or is a carrier, it's a good idea to get tested before you start a family.

That way you can understand your risk of passing on a blood disorder to any children you have, and discuss options for a healthy pregnancy with your GP or another healthcare professional.

Finding out you're a carrier
----------------------------

If the test shows you're a carrier of sickle cell, thalassaemia or another haemoglobin variant, you'll be contacted by a specialist nurse or midwife counsellor for genetic counselling.

You'll get a specific carrier result depending on the unusual haemoglobin gene you have inherited.

You can find more detailed information about different types of carrier in these leaflets:

[GOV.UK: Sickle cell carrier](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sickle-cell-carrier-description-in-brief)  
[GOV.UK: Beta thalassaemia carrier](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/beta-thalassaemia-carrier-description-in-brief)  
[GOV.UK: Delta beta thalassaemia carrier](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delta-beta-thalassaemia-carrier-description-in-brief)

[GOV.UK: Haemoglobin O Arab carrier](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/haemoglobin-o-arab-carrier-description-in-brief)  
[GOV.UK: Haemoglobin C carrier](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/haemoglobin-c-carrier-description-in-brief)

[GOV.UK: Haemoglobin Lepore carrier](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/haemoglobin-lepore-carrier-description-in-brief)

There's a chance that other members of your family could be carriers, too.

You may want to encourage them to ask for a test, especially if they're planning to have a baby.

They can ask their GP or local sickle cell and thalassaemia centre for a free test at any time.

What if I get pregnant and me or my partner is a carrier?
---------------------------------------------------------

### **If 1 parent is a carrier**

If you know that either you or your partner is a carrier of sickle cell or thalassaemia, the other parent should get tested as soon as possible if you want to understand your child's risk of inheriting one of these blood disorders so you can find out about all your options.

### **If both parents are carriers**

If you're pregnant and already know that both you and your partner are carriers (for example, because you found out in a previous pregnancy), talk to your GP or midwife as soon as possible.

You'll then have the option of being offered a diagnostic test to find out if your baby's affected.

Information about you
---------------------

If it looks like you or your baby has sickle cell disease or thalassaemia, this information will be passed to the [National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS)](https://www.ndrs.nhs.uk/).

This helps the NHS sickle cell and thalassaemia screening programme improve screening services.

You can opt out of the register at any time [by visiting the opt-out section of the National Disease Registration Service website](https://www.ndrs.nhs.uk/patients/opting-out/).

Markdown Content:
**Most antenatal screening tests will not find anything, but there's a chance you'll be told your baby could be born with a condition.**

If this happens to you, there's always support available.

Get as much information as you can
----------------------------------

It can help to find out as much as you can about the condition your baby may have.

A specialist doctor (obstetrician) or midwife will explain what the screening results mean and talk to you about your options.

### Your appointments

Your appointments should take place in a private and quiet space. But this can sometimes be difficult in a busy hospital.

You can bring your partner, a family member or friend with you.

It might help to write down any questions you have before you go. Ask the doctor or midwife to explain anything again if you need them to.

Information:

**You could ask things like:**

*   Can you explain what my baby may have?
*   What would that mean for my baby?
*   Will we need any special care or treatment before birth?
*   What would life be like for my baby if they have this condition?

Next steps
----------

You may be offered a further screening test called non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), which is a blood test.

You may also be offered diagnostic tests that can check if your baby definitely has the condition screening tests have said they might have.

The tests you may be offered are:

*   [amniocentesis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/amniocentesis/)
*   [chorionic villus sampling (CVS)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chorionic-villus-sampling-cvs/)

You may also have further scans.

It's up to you to decide if you want to do any further tests. You can discuss this with a doctor or midwife.

Making a decision to continue with or end your pregnancy
--------------------------------------------------------

This can be a very difficult decision. You may find you feel differently from one day to the next.

You do not have to make this decision on your own. Speak to your doctor, midwife, family and friends about your options.

You have time to think about your decision – whatever you decide, you'll have support.
