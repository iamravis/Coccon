Markdown Content:
Sickness in pregnancy (sometimes called morning sickness) is common. Around 8 out of every 10 pregnant women feel sick (nausea), are sick (vomiting) or both during pregnancy. This does not just happen in the morning.

For most women, this improves or stops completely by around weeks 12 to 20, although for some women it can last longer.

Some pregnant women experience very bad nausea and vomiting. They might be sick many times a day and be unable to keep food or drink down, which can impact on their daily life.

This excessive nausea and vomiting is known as hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), and often needs hospital treatment.

Exactly how many pregnant women get HG is not known as some cases may go unreported, but it's thought to be around 1 to 3 in every 100.

If you are being sick frequently and cannot keep food down, tell your midwife or doctor, or contact the hospital as soon as possible. There is a risk you may become dehydrated, and your midwife or doctor can make sure you get the right treatment.

Symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum
----------------------------------

HG is much worse than the normal nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

Signs and symptoms of HG include:

*   prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting
*   [dehydration](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dehydration/) – symptoms include feeling thirsty, tired, dizzy or lightheaded, not peeing very much, and having dark yellow and strong-smelling pee
*   weight loss

Unlike regular pregnancy sickness, HG may not get better by 16 to 20 weeks. It may not clear up completely until the baby is born, although some symptoms may improve at around 20 weeks.

See your GP or midwife if you have severe nausea and vomiting. Getting help early can help you avoid dehydration and weight loss.

There are other conditions that can cause nausea and vomiting, and your doctor will need to rule these out first.

[See videos and written interviews of women talking about their experiences of hyperemesis gravidarum on the healthtalk website](https://healthtalk.org/pregnancy/sickness-and-hyperemesis).

What causes hyperemesis gravidarum?
-----------------------------------

It's not known exactly what causes HG, or why some women get it and others do not. There is evidence that it is linked to the changing hormones in your body that occur during pregnancy.

There is some evidence that it runs in families, so if you have a mother or sister who has had HG in a pregnancy, you may be more likely to get it yourself.

If you have had HG in a previous pregnancy, you are more likely to get it in your next pregnancy than women who have never had it before, so it's worth planning in advance.

Treating hyperemesis gravidarum
-------------------------------

There are medicines that can be used in pregnancy, including the first 12 weeks, to help improve the symptoms of HG. These include anti-sickness (anti-emetic) drugs, steroids, or a combination of these.

You may need to try different types of medicine until you find what works best for you.

You can visit the [Bumps website](http://www.medicinesinpregnancy.org/Medicine--pregnancy/) to find out which medicines are safe to use in pregnancy.

If your nausea and vomiting cannot be controlled, you may need to be admitted to hospital. This is so doctors can assess your condition and give you the right treatment to protect the health of you and your baby.

Treatment can include intravenous fluids, which are given directly into a vein through a drip. If you have severe vomiting, the anti-sickness drugs may also need to be given into a vein or a muscle.

The charity [Pregnancy Sickness Support](https://www.pregnancysicknesssupport.org.uk/) has information and tips on coping with nausea and vomiting, including HG.

Will hyperemesis gravidarum harm my baby?
-----------------------------------------

HG can make you feel very unwell, but it's unlikely to harm your baby if treated effectively.

However, if it causes you to lose weight during pregnancy, there is an increased risk that your baby may be born smaller than expected (have a low birthweight).

How you might feel
------------------

The nausea and vomiting of HG can impact your life at a time when you were expecting to be enjoying pregnancy and looking forward to the birth of your baby.

It can affect you both emotionally and physically. The symptoms can be hard to cope with. Without treatment HG may also lead to further health complications, such as [depression](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/depression-in-adults/overview/) or tears in your oesophagus.

Severe sickness can be exhausting and stop you doing everyday tasks, such as going to work or even getting out of bed.

In addition to feeling very unwell and tired, you might also feel:

*   anxious about going out or being too far from home in case you need to vomit
*   isolated because you do not know anyone who understands what it's like to have HG
*   confused as to why this is happening to you
*   unsure about how to cope with the rest of the pregnancy if you continue to feel very ill

If you feel any of these, do not keep it to yourself. Talk to your midwife or doctor, and explain the impact HG is having on your life and how it is making you feel. You could also talk to a partner, family members and friends if you want to.

If you want to talk to someone who has been through HG, you can contact [Pregnancy Sickness Support's help section](https://www.pregnancysicknesssupport.org.uk/get-help/). They have a support network across the UK and can put you in touch with someone who has had HG.

Bear in mind that HG is much worse than regular pregnancy sickness. It is not the result of anything you have or have not done, and you do need treatment and support.

Another pregnancy
-----------------

If you have had HG before, it's likely you will get it again in another pregnancy.

If you decide on another pregnancy, it can help to plan ahead, such as arranging child care so you can get plenty of rest.

You could try doing things that helped last time.

Talk to your doctor about starting medicine early.

Blood clots and hyperemesis gravidarum
--------------------------------------

Because HG can cause dehydration, there's also an increased risk of having a blood clot (deep vein thrombosis), although this is rare.

If you are dehydrated and immobile, there is treatment that you can be given to prevent blood clots.

How pregnancy affects asthma
----------------------------

If you have asthma, it's hard to predict whether your [asthma symptoms](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/asthma/symptoms/) will be any different in pregnancy. Your symptoms may improve, stay the same or get worse.

### Important

See a GP, asthma nurse or specialist as soon as you know you're pregnant for advice on how to manage your asthma. Also, tell your midwife you have asthma.

Your midwife will support you throughout your pregnancy, but your GP, asthma nurse or specialist will continue to manage your asthma care.

You're more likely to have [acid reflux](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heartburn-and-acid-reflux/) while pregnant, which can make your asthma worse. Acid reflux is where stomach acid travels back up towards your throat.

### Urgent advice: Call your GP, asthma nurse or NHS 111 immediately if you’re:

*   using more of your reliever inhaler than usual
*   coughing or wheezing more, especially at night
*   feeling shortness of breath or tightness in your chest

Any of these could mean your asthma is getting worse and needs to be checked. A healthcare professional can review your medicines and make changes if necessary.

### Immediate action required: Call 999 if you're having an asthma attack and any of these apply:

*   you do not have your inhaler with you
*   you feel worse despite using your inhaler
*   you do not feel better after taking 10 puffs of your inhaler

Asthma treatments and pregnancy
-------------------------------

Most asthma medicines are safe to use in pregnancy and, if your asthma is well controlled, there's little to no risk for you or your baby.

You should continue to take your prescribed [asthma treatments](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/asthma/treatment/) throughout your pregnancy. Unless your asthma gets worse, your treatment can remain exactly the same as before.

Do not stop taking your asthma medicine – talk to a GP, asthma nurse or specialist first.

Your symptoms may get worse if you stop taking your medicine. This can pose a risk for your own health and increase the risk of your baby having a low birthweight.

### **Asthma treatments and breastfeeding**

It's safe to continue any asthma treatment while you're [breastfeeding](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/breastfeeding-first-days/). Even when you're busy with your new baby, it's important not to neglect your own health and to keep your asthma under control.

Managing your asthma during pregnancy
-------------------------------------

There are things you can do to help manage your asthma during pregnancy, such as:

*   continuing to use your [preventer inhaler (steroids)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/asthma/treatment/) as prescribed – it’s important your asthma is well controlled during pregnancy
*   not smoking during pregnancy because it’s harmful for you and your unborn baby – get tips on [stopping smoking in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/stop-smoking/)
*   avoiding things that trigger allergic reactions, such as pet fur and grass pollen
*   controlling [hay fever](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hay-fever/) by using petroleum jelly around your nostrils, regularly rinsing your nose with a salt water solution, or taking medicines like [antihistamines](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/antihistamines/) – talk to a doctor or pharmacist about which antihistamines are safe to take in pregnancy
*   continuing to exercise and eat a healthy diet – exercise can sometimes trigger asthma, so ask your GP, asthma nurse or specialist for advice if your asthma symptoms get worse while exercising
*   having the [flu jab in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/flu-jab/)

Find out more about having a [healthy diet in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/have-a-healthy-diet/), [exercise in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/exercise/) and [medicines in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/medicines/).

[Visit Asthma + Lung UK for more information on asthma and pregnancy](https://www.asthmaandlung.org.uk/conditions/asthma/manage/pregnancy/), or call their helpline on 0300 222 5800 (Monday to Friday, 9.15am to 5pm).

Asthma and giving birth
-----------------------

It is very rare to have an asthma attack during labour. If you have asthma symptoms during labour it’s safe to use your reliever inhaler as normal.

Make sure you tell your midwife and the hospital staff about any allergies you have.

Title: Congenital heart disease in pregnancy

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/existing-health-conditions/congenital-heart-disease/

Published Time: 1 Dec 2020, 5:06 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Around 8 in 1,000 babies are born with something wrong with their heart. This can sometimes be called a cardiac abnormality, [congenital heart disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/congenital-heart-disease/) or congenital heart defect.

If you were born with a cardiac abnormality and have had a successful operation to correct it, you'll probably have some scarring of the heart. This may make you more prone to infections or an irregular heartbeat.

If you have heart disease you may be able to have a successful pregnancy, but pregnancy puts your heart under significant strain. This can lead to problems, so talk to your doctor before you get pregnant or as soon as you know you're pregnant.

See a heart specialist (cardiologist)
-------------------------------------

If you were born with a heart problem and you're planning to have a baby, talk to your cardiologist before you get pregnant.

If you were treated for congenital heart disease as a baby or a child, you may not have seen a heart specialist for many years. So getting regular checks if you're planning a pregnancy, or are pregnant, is important.

If you do not have a cardiologist, ask a GP to refer you to one.

Your doctor can talk with you about:

*   any medicine you're taking and whether this may need adjusting in pregnancy
*   how your heart condition might affect your pregnancy
*   how pregnancy might affect your heart condition

Do not stop taking your medicine without speaking to your doctor.

Your care in pregnancy
----------------------

You'll be referred to a hospital maternity unit for team-based care (the team will include a cardiologist, obstetrician and midwife).

You may be able to attend a special cardiac pregnancy clinic if there's one in your area. Ask your GP for details or contact the [Somerville Heart Foundation](https://sfhearts.org.uk/) – a charity for grown-up congenital heart disease patients.

A congenital heart disease cardiologist will assess you and plan your care with you. It's hard to predict the effect of congenital heart disease on your pregnancy because each case is different.

The only way to estimate your risk and to determine what complications, if any, you might have during pregnancy is to have a careful assessment by a specialist.

It's important to know what problems could arise. Depending on what type of congenital heart disease you have, you may develop fluid on the lungs, [heart failure](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-failure/) or [arrythmia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/arrhythmia/) (an irregular and/or fast heartbeat).

Your baby
---------

Your congenital heart disease can affect your baby. Your baby may be smaller if your heart does not pump as efficiently as it should and delivers less oxygen and nutrients to the placenta and your developing baby.

Babies may be born [prematurely](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/premature-labour-and-birth/). You'll be offered regular scans during pregnancy to ensure that your baby is growing normally and healthily.

Depending on the type of congenital heart disease you have, there's a chance that your baby could inherit the condition. For example, if you have [Marfan syndrome](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/marfan-syndrome/) there's a 1 in 2 chance your baby could inherit the condition.

If there's a chance your baby could inherit your condition, you'll be referred to a specialist who can give you advice.

The [British Heart Foundation](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/conditions/congenital-heart-disease) has information for parents on coping with a child's congenital heart disease.

You need to know as much as you can about your condition, so your baby can get special care if necessary when they are born.

Many, but not all, conditions in an unborn baby can be detected during pregnancy. The future management of your pregnancy and care of your baby will be discussed with you, and a specialist children's heart doctor (cardiac paediatrician) will advise you on the options available once your baby is born.

Treatment and self-management
-----------------------------

The treatment you receive will depend on what condition you have. Your cardiologist will provide you with a tailored antenatal care plan.

This may mean that you have to change the medicines you take. For example, ACE inhibitors (a group of medicines used to treat heart failure) are not recommended during pregnancy. Your specialist will discuss this with you.

Do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your specialist first.

During your pregnancy, follow any advice your specialist gives you about managing your condition. Low-impact exercise, such as swimming and walking, is usually a good idea to keep you fit, but always speak to your midwife or doctor before starting any new exercise programme.

Labour and birth
----------------

Discuss your options for where you can give birth with your healthcare team. This should include a cardiologist with experience in treating congenital heart disease in pregnancy.

You may be advised to give birth in hospital and you’ll have an individual birth plan.

Depending on the type and severity of heart disease, [inducing labour](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/inducing-labour/) may not be recommended because of the effect the medicines used may have on the heart.

It's usually best to wait for spontaneous labour (labour that starts naturally), unless the baby has to be delivered early because it is safer for you or your baby.

You will not be automatically advised to have a caesarean section because you have congenital heart disease. This will depend on the type and severity of your heart disease. Your healthcare team will discuss all your options with you.

However, it may be recommended that you have a pain-free labour, which means that you may have an [epidural](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidural/), and your doctor may use [forceps or a vacuum delivery (ventouse)](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/forceps-or-vacuum-delivery/) to assist you during the delivery, as this avoids the strain of having to push the baby out.

Published Time: 1 Dec 2020, 4:06 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is when your arteries get narrower due to a build-up of fatty deposits inside them. This restricts the flow of blood and can lead to chest pain, called [angina](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/angina/), or a heart attack.

Your heart needs to work harder in pregnancy so, if you've got heart disease, it's important to get the right care and support.

You can develop heart problems for the first time during pregnancy. Or, you might not know you have a heart problem and it's discovered during your pregnancy or after you give birth.

You have a higher chance of developing CHD if you:

*   smoke
*   are overweight
*   have a family history of early CHD – if your father or brother was diagnosed with CHD before the age of 55, or your mother or sister was diagnosed before the age of 65
*   have diabetes
*   have high blood pressure
*   have high cholesterol
*   do not do enough physical activity

The more of these things you have, the more likely it is you'll develop heart disease.

Urgent advice: Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You're pregnant and have:

*   chest pain that comes and goes
*   breathlessness that comes and goes

These could be signs of a heart or lung problem and need to be checked.

You can call 111 or [get help from NHS 111 online](https://111.nhs.uk/triage/check-your-symptoms).

Immediate action required: Call 999 if you have:
------------------------------------------------

sudden chest pain that:

*   spreads to your arms, back, neck, jaw or tummy
*   makes your chest feel tight or heavy
*   also started with shortness of breath, sweating and feeling or being sick

This could be a sign of a heart attack.

Planning for pregnancy
----------------------

If you have heart disease, the best way to ensure a healthy pregnancy is to visit your GP or heart specialist (cardiologist) before you start trying for a baby. This is called pre-pregnancy counselling or pre-conception counselling.

Your specialist can discuss with you:

*   how your heart condition might affect your pregnancy
*   how pregnancy might affect your heart condition
*   your medicine – this may include a plan for stopping your medicine or switching to a different one to minimise the risks to you and your baby

If it is not possible to stop taking certain medicines, your doctor can discuss the chances of any problems associated with this treatment during your pregnancy.

Do not stop taking any medicines without consulting your doctor or cardiologist first.

### Aspirin

If you're taking [low-dose aspirin](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/low-dose-aspirin/) for your condition, it's safe to continue during pregnancy.

### Stent

If you have had a stent (a tiny tube used to widen a blood vessel) inserted to stop your arteries from becoming narrowed or blocked, you'll need to discuss with your cardiologist:

*   how pregnancy may affect the stent
*   the best way of managing the stent in pregnancy so it works properly

### Getting ready for pregnancy

You can prepare for pregnancy by:

*   losing weight, if you're overweight
*   not smoking
*   exercising regularly

Find out more about [coronary heart disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronary-heart-disease/).

What problems can CHD cause in pregnancy?
-----------------------------------------

Cardiac disease and blood clots are the leading causes of death in pregnancy and the first few weeks after the birth.

Some of the medicines you may be taking for CHD or related conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, can affect your baby. Talk to your care team about the medicines you're taking and the risk and benefits to you and your baby.

Your care in pregnancy
----------------------

During your pregnancy, you should be under the care of a consultant obstetrician and a cardiologist in a hospital maternity unit.

You can expect to have more frequent antenatal check-ups, particularly if your CHD is related to other conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.

Make sure you attend all your appointments or reschedule them if you have to cancel.

While you're pregnant you should:

*   eat a balanced diet – find out more about [a healthy diet in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/have-a-healthy-diet/) and [foods to avoid in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/foods-to-avoid/)
*   talk to a midwife about weight changes in pregnancy and how to stay in a healthy range
*   stay physically active – but speak to your midwife or GP before taking up any new exercise
*   [stop smoking](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/stop-smoking/)

Labour and birth
----------------

Discuss your options for where you can give birth with your healthcare team. This might include a heart specialist with experience in treating heart disease during pregnancy.

You may be advised to give birth in hospital.

Published Time: 1 Dec 2020, 5:06 p.m.

Markdown Content:
If you become pregnant and you have diabetes, you should go on to have a healthy baby. But there are some possible complications you should be aware of.

The information on this page is relevant for you if you were diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes before you got pregnant.

It does not cover [gestational diabetes](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gestational-diabetes/), which is high blood sugar that develops during pregnancy and usually goes away after the baby is born.

What it means for you
---------------------

If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, you may be at higher risk of having:

*   a large baby – which increases the risk of a difficult birth, having your [labour induced](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/inducing-labour/) or needing a [caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/)
*   a [miscarriage](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/miscarriage/)

People with diabetes (whether they are pregnant or not) are at risk of developing problems with their eyes ([diabetic retinopathy](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetic-retinopathy/)) and kidneys (diabetic nephropathy).

Some people with type 1 diabetes can develop [diabetic ketoacidosis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetic-ketoacidosis/), where harmful chemicals called ketones build up in the blood.

Pregnancy can increase your risk of developing these problems or make existing ones worse.

What it means for your baby
---------------------------

If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, your baby may be at higher risk of:

*   having health problems shortly after birth, such as heart and breathing problems, and needing hospital care
*   developing obesity or diabetes later in life

There's also a slightly higher chance of your baby being born with birth defects, particularly heart and nervous system abnormalities, or being stillborn or dying soon after birth.

But managing your diabetes well, before and during your pregnancy, will help to reduce these risks.

Reducing the risks
------------------

The best way to reduce the risks to you and your baby is to ensure your diabetes is well controlled before you become pregnant. So, ideally, a pregnancy should be planned.

Before you start trying for a baby, ask your GP or diabetes specialist (diabetologist) for advice. You should be referred to a diabetic pre-conception clinic for support.

[Find diabetes information and support near you](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/other-health-services/diabetes-information-and-support)

You should be offered a blood test, called an HbA1c test, every month. This measures the level of glucose in your blood.

It's best if the level is no more than 6.5% before you get pregnant. If you cannot get your level below 6.5%, try to get it as close as possible to reduce the risk of complications for you and your baby.

If your blood glucose level is above 10%, your care team should strongly advise you not to try for a baby until it has fallen.

You should continue using contraceptives until you get your blood glucose under control. A GP or diabetes specialist can advise you about how best to do this.

If you have type 1 diabetes, you should be given testing strips and a monitor to test your blood ketone levels, to check for [diabetic ketoacidosis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetic-ketoacidosis/). You should use these if your blood glucose levels are high, or if you are being sick or have diarrhoea.

### **Folic acid**

If you have diabetes and are trying to get pregnant, you should take 5 milligrams (mg) of folic acid each day (and until you are 12 weeks pregnant). A doctor will have to prescribe this, because you cannot buy 5mg tablets from a pharmacy or shop without a prescription.

Taking folic acid helps prevent your baby developing birth defects, such as [spina bifida](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/spina-bifida/).

### **Your diabetes treatment in pregnancy**

Your doctors may recommend changing your treatment regime during pregnancy.

If you usually take tablets to control your diabetes, you'll normally be advised to switch to insulin injections, either with or without a medicine called metformin.

If you already use insulin injections to control your diabetes, you may need to switch to a different type of insulin.

If you take medicines for conditions related to your diabetes, such as high blood pressure, these may have to be changed.

It's very important to attend any appointments made for you so that your care team can monitor your condition and react to any changes that could affect your or your baby's health.

You will need to monitor your blood glucose levels more frequently during pregnancy, especially since [nausea and vomiting in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/vomiting-and-morning-sickness/) (known as "morning sickness", although it can happen at any time of the day) can affect them. Your GP or midwife will be able to advise you on this.

Keeping your blood glucose levels low may mean you have more [low-blood-sugar (hypoglycaemic)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/low-blood-sugar-hypoglycaemia/) attacks ("hypos"). These are harmless for your baby, but you and your partner need to know how to cope with them. Talk to your doctor or diabetes specialist.

Diabetic eye screening in pregnancy
-----------------------------------

You will be offered regular diabetic eye screening during your pregnancy. This is to check for signs of [diabetic eye disease (diabetic retinopathy)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetic-retinopathy/).

Screening is very important when you are pregnant because the risk of serious eye problems is greater in pregnancy.

Diabetic retinopathy is treatable, especially if it is caught early.

If you decide not to have regular screening tests, you should tell the clinician looking after your diabetes care during pregnancy.

[Read about diabetic eye screening](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetic-eye-screening/)

Labour and birth
----------------

If you have diabetes, it's strongly recommended that you give birth in a hospital with the support of a consultant-led maternity team.

Your doctors may recommend having your labour started early (induced). This is because there may be an increased risk of complications for you or your baby if your pregnancy carries on for too long.

If your baby is larger than expected, your doctors might discuss your options for the delivery and may suggest an elective caesarean section.

Your blood glucose should be measured every hour during labour and birth. You may be given a drip in your arm with insulin and glucose if there are problems.

After the birth
---------------

Feed your baby as soon as possible after the birth (within 30 minutes) to help keep their blood glucose at a safe level.

Your baby will have a [heel prick blood test](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/newborn-screening/blood-spot-test/) (or newborn blood spot test) a few hours after they're born to check if their blood glucose level is too low.

If your baby's blood glucose cannot be kept at a safe level, or they're having problems feeding, they may need extra care. Your baby may need to be fed through a tube or given a drip to increase their blood glucose.

[Read more about special care for babies](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/after-the-birth/special-care-ill-or-premature-babies/)

After your pregnancy, you should not need as much insulin to control your blood glucose. You should be able to decrease your insulin to your pre-pregnancy dose or return to the tablets you were taking before you became pregnant. Talk to your doctor about this.

You should be offered a test to check your blood glucose levels before you go home and at your 6-week [postnatal check](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/support-and-services/your-6-week-postnatal-check/). You should also be given advice about diet and exercise.

If you have epilepsy you may be nervous about what it means for your pregnancy and baby.

Try not to worry, as it is likely that you will have a healthy pregnancy and go on to have a healthy baby. But there is a slightly higher risk of having a baby with a birth defect or developmental problem, so it's important to get the right support.

Important
---------

If you find out you're pregnant, do not stop taking your anti-epilepsy medicine until you've spoken with your doctor or specialist.

Planning on getting pregnant
----------------------------

If you're taking anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) and you're planning to get pregnant, you should continue to use [contraception](https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/) and take your medicine until you discuss your plans with a GP or epilepsy specialist (neurologist).

This is because your doctor may want to make changes to the dose or type of medicine you are taking, which is best done before you become pregnant.

You should also be offered pre-conception counselling, which will help you understand any risks and plan for a healthy pregnancy and baby.

Men who take sodium valproate or valproic acid and are planning to start a family, or whose partners could get pregnant should speak to their doctor.

You should both use contraception while you're taking valproic acid or sodium valproate and for at least 3 months after stopping.

This is because there's a small risk these medicines may cause learning or behavioural problems in your child if you become pregnant while your partner is taking these medicines.

Effect of pregnancy on your epilepsy
------------------------------------

It's difficult to predict how pregnancy will affect epilepsy. Your epilepsy may be unaffected, or you may see an improvement in your condition.

However, as pregnancy can cause physical and emotional stress, as well as increased tiredness, your seizures may become more frequent. If this happens to you, let your doctor, midwife or neurologist know.

Risks from epilepsy medicines
-----------------------------

Research has shown that there is an increased risk of your child not developing normally if you take some types of AED during pregnancy, including:

*   [sodium valproate](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/sodium-valproate/)
*   [valproic acid](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/valproic-acid/)
*   [carbamazepine](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/carbamazepine/)
*   phenobarbital
*   [phenytoin](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/phenytoin/)
*   [topiramate](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/topiramate/)

These medicines may cause problems such as spina bifida, cleft lip or heart abnormalities. They may also give your baby a higher chance of brain development problems, such as a delay in developing speech and language, and problems with memory and attention.

To reduce these risks, talk to a GP or neurologist about your medicines before you get pregnant or if you're planning to get pregnant. They may want to switch you to an alternative treatment. [Lamotrigine](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/lamotrigine/) and [levetiracetam](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/levetiracetam/) are safer medicines to take in pregnancy.

It's usually better to make any changes to your medicine before rather than during pregnancy.

If you get pregnant while you're taking an AED, continue to take it and contact your GP or neurologist immediately to discuss your treatment.

Do not change your treatment or stop taking your medicine without specialist advice, especially during pregnancy. This is because a severe seizure in pregnancy could result in harm or injury to you or your baby.

[Read the GOV.UK safety leaflet about epilepsy medicines and pregnancy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/epilepsy-medicines-and-pregnancy)

### Sodium valproate and valproic acid

There is a small risk of harm to your baby with the valproate medicines [sodium valproate](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/sodium-valproate/) and [valproic acid](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/valproic-acid/).

If you or your partner are taking a valproate medicine and are planning to get pregnant or find out that you are pregnant, do not stop taking your medicine. See a GP or neurologist immediately to discuss your increased risk and whether this is still the best treatment for you.

Women living with epilepsy who are able to get pregnant must not be given a valproate medicine unless no other treatment is suitable and they have enrolled in Prevent, the valproate pregnancy prevention programme. This is designed to make sure they understand:

*   the risks of taking valproate medicines in pregnancy
*   the need to use effective contraception to prevent pregnancy

As part of the pregnancy prevention programme, you'll need to:

*   see your consultant at least once a year to discuss your treatment
*   discuss the risks of your medicine and the importance of avoiding pregnancy
*   sign a form stating you understand the risks to your unborn baby if you take a valproate medicine, and agree to use effective contraception throughout your treatment

Your doctor may refer you to contraception services.

Your doctor will give you an information leaflet to explain more about the risks and how to avoid them. Keep this information in case you need to refer to it again.

Men who are taking sodium valproate or valproic acid should use effective contraception while taking it and for 3 months after stopping. This is because there's a small risk these medicines may cause learning or behavioural problems in your child if you become pregnant while your partner is taking these medicines.

[Read more from the Epilepsy Society about sodium valproate](https://epilepsysociety.org.uk/about-epilepsy/sodium-valproate)

[Read more from GOV.UK on valproate use by women and girls](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/valproate-use-by-women-and-girls)

Folic acid
----------

If you're taking medicine to control your epilepsy, you will need to take 5 milligrams (5mg) of folic acid once a day as soon as you start trying to get pregnant

This will need to be prescribed for you, usually by a GP, as it is a higher dose than normal.

If you become pregnant unexpectedly and have not been taking folic acid, make an appointment with a GP and start taking it straight away. You can buy the lower dose 400 microgram tablets from a pharmacy before you get a prescription for the 5mg tablets.

Talk to a GP or pharmacist if you need any advice.

Your care during pregnancy
--------------------------

Before you become pregnant, or as early in your pregnancy as possible, you'll be referred to an obstetrician, who will discuss and plan your care during pregnancy. If necessary, a neurologist may also be involved in putting this plan together.

You may need extra appointments and scans to check your baby's development, or blood tests, to check the level of anti-epileptic medicines in your blood, depending on which AEDs you take.

You can talk to your care team about how epilepsy may be inherited and any other concerns you have.

Labour, birth and beyond
------------------------

Depending on your risk of having a seizure during labour your doctors will usually recommend that you give birth in a consultant-led maternity unit in hospital.

See [Where to give birth: the options](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/where-to-give-birth-the-options/) for more information about giving birth in hospital.

During labour you'll be looked after by a midwife, and doctors will be available if you need their help. You should bring your epilepsy medicine with you to the hospital and continue to take it as you normally would.

Read about [what happens in labour and birth](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/).

All newborns have low levels of vitamin K so you'll be offered a vitamin K injection for your baby soon after birth to help their blood to clot. Some AED medicines can lower their vitamin K levels further.

There's usually no reason why you cannot [breastfeed your baby](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/breastfeeding-and-bottle-feeding/). Even if some of your medicine gets into your milk, the benefits of breastfeeding often outweigh any risks. Your midwife, obstetrician or pharmacist can give you advice based on your circumstances.

The UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register
--------------------------------------

This nationwide project is investigating which epilepsy treatments pose the lowest risk to a baby's health. If you're pregnant and living with epilepsy, you can join the [UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register](http://www.epilepsyandpregnancy.co.uk/).

When you register, you'll be asked to provide information about any treatment you're taking. Information about the health of your baby will be collected after your baby is born. This helps doctors give the best advice to those living with epilepsy who are thinking of getting pregnant.

Markdown Content:
Being obese when you're pregnant increases the chance of some complications such as [gestational diabetes](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gestational-diabetes/). Make sure you go to all your antenatal appointments so your pregnancy team can monitor the health of you and your baby.

To find out if you are [obese](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/obesity/) (very overweight), use the [BMI healthy weight calculator](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/).

Your weight during pregnancy
----------------------------

If you are obese, usually defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or above, and pregnant, do not try to lose weight during your pregnancy. It will not reduce the chance of complications and may not be safe.

The best way to protect you and your baby’s health is to go to all your antenatal appointments. This is so your midwife, doctor and any other health professionals can help with any problems you might face and take steps to prevent or manage them.

Eating and exercise
-------------------

It's important to eat a [healthy, balanced diet](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/have-a-healthy-diet/) and do some [physical activity](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/exercise/) every day. You should be offered a referral to a dietitian or other health professional for advice on healthy eating and physical activity. Being physically active in pregnancy will not harm your baby.

Try eating healthily (including knowing [what foods to avoid in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/foods-to-avoid/)) and doing activities such as walking or swimming.

If you were not active before pregnancy, it's a good idea to consult your midwife or doctor before starting a new exercise plan when you're pregnant.

Your care in pregnancy
----------------------

If you are obese in pregnancy, you'll be offered a test for [gestational diabetes](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/existing-health-conditions/diabetes/).

You may also be referred to an anaesthetist to discuss issues such as pain relief in labour. You're more likely to have an instrumental delivery ([ventouse or forceps](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/forceps-or-vacuum-delivery/) or a [caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/)), and it can be difficult for an epidural to be given.

Talk to your midwife or doctor about your birth options. Ask if there are any particular safety concerns for you around giving birth at home or in a birthing pool.

You may be advised to give birth in a hospital where there's easy access to medical care if you need it.

Find out more about [your options on where to give birth](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/where-to-give-birth-the-options/).

Possible problems if you're overweight in pregnancy
---------------------------------------------------

Being overweight increases the chance of complications for you and your baby. The higher your BMI, the higher the chance of complications. The increasing chances are in relation to:

*   [miscarriage](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/miscarriage/)
*   [gestational diabetes](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gestational-diabetes/) 
*   [high blood pressure](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/high-blood-pressure-hypertension/) and [pre-eclampsia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/) 
*   [blood clots](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-clots/) 
*   the baby's shoulder becoming "stuck" during labour ([The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has more information about shoulder dystocia](https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/patients/patient-leaflets/shoulder-dystocia/))
*   heavier bleeding than normal after the birth

You are also more likely to need an instrumental delivery [(forceps or ventouse)](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/forceps-or-vacuum-delivery/), or an emergency [caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/).

Possible problems for your baby if you're overweight in pregnancy
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Problems for your baby can include being born early (before 37 weeks), and an increased chance of [stillbirth](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stillbirth/).

There is also a higher chance of your baby having a health condition, such as a neural tube defect like [spina bifida](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/spina-bifida/).

Although the chances of these problems increase if you are obese, most pregnancies will result in a healthy baby.

You can find out more in a leaflet from the [Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists: being overweight in pregnancy and after birth](https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/patients/patient-leaflets/being-overweight-pregnancy-after-birth/).

Title: Antenatal classes

Published Time: 1 Dec 2020, 4 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Antenatal classes can help you to prepare for your baby's birth and give you confidence and information.

They're usually informative and fun, and they're free on the NHS.

You can learn how to:

*   look after and feed your baby
*   stay healthy during pregnancy
*   make a birth plan, considering the different arrangements for labour and birth and the choices available to you

You may also meet some of the people who will look after you during labour and after the birth. You'll be able to discuss your plans and any worries with professionals and other parents.

Antenatal classes are also a good way to make friends with other parents who are expecting babies around the same time as you. These friendships can help you through the first few months with your baby.

Choosing an antenatal class
---------------------------

Think about what you hope to gain from antenatal classes so you can find the sort of class that suits you best.

Places in antenatal classes can get booked up early. It's a good idea to start making enquiries early in pregnancy so you can secure a place in the class that you choose. You can attend more than 1 class.

To find out about classes near you, ask your midwife, health visitor or GP. NHS antenatal classes are free.

Speak to your community midwife if you cannot go to classes.

When to have antenatal classes
------------------------------

You might be able to attend introductory classes on baby care early in pregnancy, but most antenatal classes start around 8 to 10 weeks before your baby is due, when you're around 30 to 32 weeks pregnant.

If you're expecting [twins](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/giving-birth-to-twins-or-more/), start your classes when you're around [24 weeks pregnant](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/week-by-week/13-to-27/24-weeks/) because your babies are more likely to be born early. Some units offer special antenatal classes if you're expecting multiples – ask your midwife about this.

What happens in antenatal classes
---------------------------------

Classes are normally held once a week, either during the day or in the evening, for around 2 hours. Some classes are just for you, others welcome partners or friends to some or all of the sessions. In some areas, there are set classes for if you're single, a teenager or if English is not your first language.

[Find out more about teenage pregnancy support](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/support/teenage-pregnancy/)

The kinds of topics covered by antenatal classes are:

*   [health in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/), including a [healthy diet](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/have-a-healthy-diet/)
*   [exercises to keep you fit and active](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/exercise/) during pregnancy
*   what happens during [labour and birth](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/)
*   coping with labour and information about different types of [pain relief](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/pain-relief-in-labour/)
*   how to help yourself during labour and birth
*   relaxation techniques
*   information about different kinds of birth and interventions, such as [forceps or vacuum delivery](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/forceps-or-vacuum-delivery/)
*   caring for your baby, including feeding
*   your health after the birth
*   refresher classes for those who've already had a baby
*   [emotions and feelings during pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/support/feelings-and-relationships/), birth and after

Some classes cover all these topics. Others focus on certain aspects, such as exercises and relaxation, or caring for your baby.

The number of different antenatal classes available varies from place to place.

Children's Centres
------------------

Children's Centres also support families with children under the age of 5. They can provide:

*   easy access to antenatal care
*   health services
*   parenting and family support
*   drop-in sessions

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/how-to-make-a-birth-plan/

Published Time: 1 Dec 2020, 4:07 p.m.

Markdown Content:
A birth plan is a record of what you would like to happen during your [labour](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/signs-that-labour-has-begun/), birth, and after the birth. You don't have to create a birth plan but, if you would like one, your midwife will be able to help.

Discussing a birth plan with your midwife will help you understand your options during labour and birth, including the risks and benefits of each option. You'll have the chance to ask questions and find out more about what happens during labour and birth.

It also gives your midwife the chance to get to know you better, and understand your feelings and priorities, and allows you to think about or discuss some things more fully with your partner, friends and relatives.

You can change your mind about your wishes for labour and birth at any time.

Your personal circumstances
---------------------------

Your birth plan is personal to you. It depends on what you want, your medical history, your circumstances and what is available at your maternity service.

You might be given a special form for your birth plan, or there may be room in your notes. It's a good idea to keep a copy of your birth plan with you so you can show your midwife when you're in labour.

The maternity team who care for you during labour will discuss it with you so they know what you want.

Be flexible
-----------

You need to be flexible and prepared to do things differently from your birth plan if complications arise with you or your baby, or if facilities such as a birth pool aren't available.

The maternity team will tell you what they advise in your particular circumstances. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you need to.

Things to consider
------------------

You can find out more about the things you need to think about when making a birth plan, such as:

*   [where you can give birth](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/where-to-give-birth-the-options/)
*   [pain relief](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/pain-relief-in-labour/)
*   [forceps or vacuum delivery](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/forceps-or-vacuum-delivery/)
*   [your newborn baby](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/after-the-birth/getting-to-know-your-newborn/)

Choosing your birth location
----------------------------

You can give birth at home, in a unit run by midwives (a midwifery unit or birth centre) or in hospital.

Your choices about where to have your baby depend on your needs, risks and, to some extent, on where you live.

You can usually consider any of these birth locations. But if your pregnancy is high risk or you have certain medical conditions, it's safest to give birth in hospital, where specialists are available. This is in case you need treatment during labour.

If your pregnancy is low risk and you give birth at home or in a unit run by midwives, you’re less likely to need assistance such as forceps or ventouse (sometimes called instrumental delivery).

Wherever you choose, the place should feel right for you. You can change your mind at any point in your pregnancy.

Find out what's in your area
----------------------------

Your midwife will discuss the options available in your area but if you're willing to travel, you're free to choose any maternity services.

As well as from your midwife, you can get information from:

*   children's centres
*   your GP surgery
*   local maternity units – [find maternity services near you](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/other-health-services/maternity-services)

You may also want to get advice from your friends and family.

Talk to your midwife about going to have a look around the local maternity services, and ask questions if you do not understand something or think you need to know more. Some hospitals also offer virtual tours on their websites.

Home birth
----------

You can choose to give birth at home. This is usually only recommended if you have a straightforward pregnancy, and both you and the baby are well.

Giving birth is generally safe wherever you choose to have your baby.

But if you’re having your first baby, home birth slightly increases the risk of serious problems for the baby – including death or issues that might affect the baby's quality of life – from 5 in 1,000 for a hospital birth to 9 in 1,000 for a home birth.

If you've had a baby before, a planned home birth is as safe as having your baby in hospital or a midwife-led unit.

It's rare, but if something goes seriously wrong during your labour at home, it could be worse for you or your baby than if you were in hospital with access to specialised care.

If you give birth at home, you'll be supported by a midwife who will be with you while you're in labour. If you need any help or your labour is not progressing as well as it should, your midwife will make arrangements for you to go to hospital.

### Advantages of home birth

The advantages of giving birth at home include:

*   being in familiar surroundings, where you may feel more relaxed and better able to cope
*   not having to interrupt your labour to go into hospital
*   not needing to leave your other children
*   not having to be separated from your partner after the birth
*   increased likelihood of being looked after by a midwife you have got to know during your pregnancy
*   if your pregnancy is low risk, a lower likelihood of having an intervention, such as [forceps or ventouse (vacuum delivery)](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/forceps-or-vacuum-delivery/), than giving birth in hospital

### Considerations

There are some things you should think about if you're considering a home birth.

You may need to transfer to a hospital if there are complications.

[Epidurals](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidural/) are not available at home, but you can use gas and air, a warm bath, a birth pool, TENS and any relaxation techniques you've learned. Find out about [pain relief in labour](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/pain-relief-in-labour/).

Your doctor or midwife may recommend you give birth in hospital – for example, if you're expecting twins or if your baby is [lying feet first (breech)](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/if-your-baby-is-breech/). Your midwife or doctor will explain why they think a hospital birth is safer for you and your baby.

If you choose to give birth at home or in a unit run by midwives, you should be given information by your midwife or GP about what would happen if you had to be transferred to hospital during labour and how long this would take.

Planning a home birth
---------------------

Ask your midwife whether a home birth is suitable for you and your baby.

If you choose to have a home birth, your midwife will arrange for members of the midwifery team to help and support you. Here are some questions you might want to ask:

*   how long would it take if I needed to be transferred to hospital?
*   which hospital would I be transferred to?
*   would a midwife be with me all the time?
*   how do I get a birthing pool?

Midwifery units or birth centres
--------------------------------

Midwifery units or birth centres are more comfortable and homely than a maternity unit in a hospital. They can be:

*   part of a hospital maternity unit, where pregnancy (obstetric), newborn (neonatal) and anaesthetic care is available
*   separate from a hospital, and without immediate obstetric, neonatal or anaesthetic care

### Advantages of a midwifery unit or birth centre

The advantages of giving birth at a midwifery unit include:

*   being in surroundings where you may feel more relaxed and better able to cope with labour
*   being more likely to be looked after by a midwife you have got to know during your pregnancy
*   the unit potentially being much nearer your home
*   if your pregnancy is low risk, a lower likelihood of having an intervention such as [forceps or ventouse (vacuum delivery)](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/forceps-or-vacuum-delivery/) than giving birth in hospital

### Considerations

There are some things to think about if you're considering giving birth in a midwifery unit or birth centre.

You may need to be transferred to a hospital if there are any complications.

In a unit that's completely separate from a hospital, you won't be able to have certain kinds of pain relief, such as an [epidural](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidural/). Ask your midwife whether the unit or centre is part of a hospital or completely separate.

Your doctor or midwife may feel it's safer for you to give birth in hospital.

Planning a birth in a midwifery unit or birth centre
----------------------------------------------------

Ask your midwife if there are any midwifery units or birth centres in your area. There may be others you can use if you're prepared to travel.

Hospital birth
--------------

Most births happen in an NHS hospital maternity unit. If you choose to give birth in hospital, you'll be looked after by midwives, but doctors will be available if you need their help.

You'll still have choices about the kind of care you want. Your midwives and doctors will provide information about what your hospital can offer.

### Advantages of hospital birth

The advantages of giving birth in hospital include:

*   direct access to obstetricians if your labour becomes complicated
*   direct access to anaesthetists, who give epidurals
*   there will be specialists in newborn care (neonatologists) and a [special care baby unit](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/baby-special-intensive-care/) if there are any problems with your baby

### Considerations

There are some things you should think about if you're considering a hospital birth:

*   you may go home directly from the labour ward or you may be moved to a postnatal ward
*   in hospital, you may be looked after by a different midwife from the one who looked after you during your pregnancy
*   you're more likely to have an epidural, [episiotomy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/episiotomy-and-perineal-tears/), or a forceps or ventouse delivery in hospital

Planning a hospital birth
-------------------------

Your midwife can help you decide which hospital feels right for you. If there's more than one hospital in your area, you can choose which one to go to. Find out more about the care provided in each so you can decide which will suit you best.

Birth questions to ask
----------------------

Here are some questions you might want to ask if you're considering having your baby in a midwifery unit or birth centre, or in hospital:

*   Are tours of the maternity facilities available before the birth?
*   When can I discuss my birth plan?
*   Are TENS machines available for pain relief or do I need to hire one?
*   What equipment is available – for example mats, a birthing chair or bean bags?
*   Are there birthing pools?
*   Are partners, close relatives or friends welcome in the delivery room?
*   Are they ever asked to leave the room – if so, why?
*   Can I move around in [labour](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/signs-that-labour-has-begun/) and find my own position for the birth?
*   What is the policy on [induction](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/inducing-labour/), [pain relief](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/pain-relief-in-labour/) and routine monitoring?
*   What types of pain relief are available, such as [epidurals](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidural/)?
*   How soon can I go home after the birth?
*   What services are provided for [premature or sick babies](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/after-the-birth/special-care-ill-or-premature-babies/)?
*   Who will help me if I breastfeed?
*   Who will help me if I choose to formula feed?
*   Will my baby be with me all the time or is there a separate nursery?
*   Are there any special rules about visiting?
*   How long would it take if I needed to be transferred to hospital from a birth centre?
*   Which hospital would I be transferred to?
*   Would a midwife be with me all the time?

Wherever you decide to give birth, you can change your mind at any stage of pregnancy. Talk to your midwife if there's anything you're not sure or want to know more about.

[Find out more about your choice of place of birth on the Birthrights website](https://www.birthrights.org.uk/factsheets/choice-of-place-of-birth/)

If you are thinking about unassisted birth
------------------------------------------

You can choose to have a home birth without a midwife with you (unassisted birth). This is sometimes called freebirth.

Talk to a midwife if you are worried about your care.

They can:

*   discuss with you the role of the midwife and help you make an informed choice
*   personalise your care and support so it’s right for you.

If you decide to have an unassisted birth, you can change your mind at any time during your pregnancy or labour. NHS midwives will always be available to support you.

A midwife can offer you support and advice during labour, and check on the health of you and your baby. They'll know if you or your baby need help, and can arrange for medical attention if needed.

If you have an unassisted birth, you’ll need to tell a GP or [local maternity services](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/other-health-services/maternity-services) about your baby’s birth as soon as they’ve been born. This is because by law every birth in the UK needs to be recorded (notified) within 36 hours. A GP or midwife will need to see you before they can notify the birth.

When the birth has been notified, your baby will get an NHS number for their NHS care.

What you'll need for labour and birth
-------------------------------------

Get a few things ready at least 3 weeks before your due date.

For yourself, you'll probably want to pack:

*   your birth plan and hospital notes
*   something loose and comfortable to wear during labour that does not restrict you from moving around or make you too hot
*   3 changes of loose, comfortable clothes
*   2 or 3 comfortable and supportive bras, including nursing bras if you're planning to breastfeed – remember, your breasts will be much larger than usual
*   breast pads
*   2 packets of super-absorbent period or maternity pads
*   5 or 6 pairs of knickers – you may want to bring some disposable ones
*   your washbag with a toothbrush, hairbrush, flannel, soap, lip balm, deodorant, hair ties and other toiletries
*   towels
*   things to help you pass the time and relax – for example, books, magazines, music or podcasts
*   a fan or water spray to cool you down
*   front-opening or loose-fitting nighties or tops if you're going to breastfeed
*   dressing gown and slippers
*   healthy snacks and drinks
*   extra pillows
*   a TENS machine if you intend to use one
*   any medicines you're taking

For the baby, you might want to pack:

*   bodysuits, vests and sleepsuits
*   an outfit for going home in
*   a hat, scratch mittens and socks or booties
*   plenty of nappies
*   a shawl or blanket
*   muslin squares or bibs
*   a car seat for the trip home

Home births
-----------

If you're planning to give birth at home, discuss your plans and what you need to prepare with your midwife. Think about where in your home you want to give birth.

You're likely to need:

*   clean bed clothes and towels
*   clothes (including a hat) and nappies for the baby
*   2 packets of super-absorbent period or maternity pads

Even if you're planning to have your baby at home, you should pack some things in case you need to go into hospital at any point.

Get prepared
------------

When you come home, you will not want to do much more than rest and care for your baby, so do as much planning as you can in advance.

If you can, buy lots of basic items such as toilet paper, period pads and nappies in advance.

If you have a freezer, you could cook some meals in advance and freeze them.

Transport
---------

You should plan how you'll get to the hospital or midwifery unit because you might need to go there at any time of the day or night.

If you're planning to go by car, make sure it's running well and that there's always enough petrol in the tank.

If someone else has said they'll take you, make an alternative arrangement just in case they're not available.

Know the signs
--------------

There are several signs that labour might be starting, including:

*   contractions or tightenings
*   a "show", when the plug of mucus from your cervix (entrance to your womb, or uterus) comes away
*   backache
*   an urge to go to the toilet, which is caused by your baby's head pressing on your bowel
*   your waters breaking

When to contact your midwife or maternity unit
----------------------------------------------

Call your midwife or maternity unit for guidance if:

*   you think you’re in labour
*   you’re having regular contractions coming every 5 minutes or more often

You can also call your midwife or maternity unit if you’re unsure or worried about anything.

Call 111 if you’re unable to contact your midwife or maternity unit.

### Urgent advice: Call your midwife or maternity unit urgently if:

*   your waters break
*   you have vaginal bleeding
*   your baby is moving less than usual
*   you're less than 37 weeks pregnant and think you might be in labour
*   any of your contractions last longer than 2 minutes
*   you're having 6 or more contractions every 10 minutes

These signs mean you need to see a midwife or doctor. Do not wait until the next day – call immediately, even if it's the middle of the night.

Call 111 if you’re unable to contact your midwife or maternity unit.

### Immediate action required: Call 999 and ask for an ambulance if:

*   you think your baby is coming now and you have a strong urge to push

Latent phase of labour
----------------------

The start of labour is called the latent phase. This is when your cervix becomes soft and thin, and starts opening for your baby to be born. This can take hours or sometimes days.

You'll probably be advised to stay at home during this time. If you go to the hospital or maternity unit, they may suggest you go back home.

Find out more about the [stages of labour](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/the-stages-of-labour-and-birth/) and what you can do at home during the latent phase.

Call your midwife if you're unsure or worried about anything.

What do contractions feel like
------------------------------

When you have a contraction, your womb tightens and then relaxes. For some people, contractions may feel like extreme period pains.

You may have had ‘practice contractions’ during your pregnancy, particularly towards the end. These tightenings are called Braxton Hicks contractions, which may feel uncomfortable, but are usually painless. Braxton Hicks contractions generally do not last that long, do not happen very frequently and do not build up.

Your contractions tend to become longer, stronger and more frequent as your labour progresses. During a contraction, your womb muscles tighten and the pain increases. If you put your hand on your abdomen, you'll feel it getting harder. When the muscles relax, the pain fades and you’ll feel the hardness ease.

The contractions are pushing your baby down and opening the entrance to your womb (the cervix), ready for your baby to go through.

Your midwife will probably advise you to stay at home until your contractions become frequent.

[Read more information on when to go to hospital](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/what-happens-at-the-hospital-or-birth-centre/)

Backache often comes on in labour
---------------------------------

You may get backache or a heavy, aching feeling.

A "show" can signal the start of labour
---------------------------------------

During pregnancy, there's a plug of mucus in your cervix. This mucus comes away just before labour starts, or when in early labour, and it may pass out of your vagina. This sticky, jelly-like pink mucus is called a show.

It may come away in 1 blob or in several pieces. It's pink because it contains a small amount of blood.

If you're losing more blood, it may be a sign something is wrong, so phone your hospital or midwife straight away.

A show indicates that the cervix is starting to open. Labour may quickly follow or may take a few days. Sometimes there is no show.

What happens when my waters break
---------------------------------

It's likely your waters will break during labour, but it can also happen before labour starts.

Your baby develops and grows inside a bag of fluid called the amniotic sac. When it's time for your baby to be born, the sac usually breaks and the amniotic fluid drains out through your vagina. This is your waters breaking. Sometimes when you're in labour, a midwife or doctor may offer to break your waters.

If your waters break naturally, you may feel a slow trickle or a sudden gush of water you cannot control. To prepare for this, you could keep a period pad (but not a tampon) handy if you're going out, and put a protective sheet on your bed.

Amniotic fluid is clear and pale. Sometimes it's difficult to tell amniotic fluid from urine. When your waters break, the water may be a little bloodstained to begin with.

Tell your midwife immediately if:

*   the waters are smelly or coloured
*   you're losing blood

This could mean you and your baby need urgent attention.

If your waters break before labour starts, call your midwife. Use a period pad (not a tampon) so your midwife can check the colour of the waters.

### If labour does not start after your waters break

It's usual to go into labour within 24 hours of the waters breaking. You'll be offered an induction if you do not because, without amniotic fluid, there's a small increased risk of infection for your baby.

Until your induction, or if you choose to wait for labour to start naturally, tell your midwife immediately if:

*   your baby moves less than usual
*   there's any change in the colour or smell of any fluid coming from your vagina

You should take your temperature every 4 hours when you're awake, and tell your midwife if it's raised. A raised temperature is usually above 37.5C, but you may need to call before this – check with your midwife.

There's no evidence that having a bath or shower after your waters have broken increases your risk of infection, but having sex might.

How to cope when labour begins
------------------------------

At the beginning of labour, you can:

*   walk or move about, if you feel like it
*   drink fluids – you may find sports (isotonic) drinks help keep your energy levels up
*   have a snack, if you feel like it
*   try any relaxation and breathing exercises you've learned to deal with contractions as they get stronger and more painful – your birth partner can help by doing these with you
*   have your [birth partner](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/tips-for-your-birth-partner/) rub your back – this can help relieve pain
*   take [paracetamol](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/paracetamol-for-adults/) according to the instructions on the packet – paracetamol is safe to take in labour
*   have a warm bath

When to go to the hospital or birth centre
------------------------------------------

If it's your first pregnancy, you may feel unsure about when you should go into hospital or a midwifery unit. The best thing to do is to call your hospital or unit for advice.

If your waters have broken, you'll probably be asked to go in to be checked.

If it's your first baby and you're having contractions but your waters have not broken, you may be advised to wait. You'll probably be asked to come in when your contractions are:

*   regular
*   strong
*   about 5 minutes apart, or coming more often

If you do not live near your hospital, you may need to come in before you get to this stage. Make sure you know the [signs of labour and what happens](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/signs-that-labour-has-begun/).

Second babies often arrive more quickly than the first, so you may need to contact the hospital, midwifery unit or midwife sooner.

Do not forget to phone the hospital or unit before leaving home, and remember to take your notes.

If you're planning a home birth, follow the procedure you have agreed with your midwife during your discussions about the onset of labour. Make sure you know the signs of labour.

What to expect at the maternity unit
------------------------------------

Maternity units vary, whether they are in hospitals or midwifery units, so the following is just a guide to what is likely to happen.

You can talk with your midwife about what's available at your local hospital or midwifery unit, and what you would like for your birth.

### Your arrival

If you carry your own notes, take them to the maternity unit admissions desk. You will be taken to the labour ward or your room, where you can change into a hospital gown or other clothes of your own.

Choose something that is loose and, ideally, made of cotton, because you'll feel hot during labour and may not want to wear anything tight.

### Examination by the midwife

The midwife will ask you about what has been happening so far and will examine you, with your permission. If you're having a home birth, this examination will take place at home. The midwife will ask to:

*   take your pulse, temperature and blood pressure, and check your urine
*   feel your abdomen to check the baby's position, and record or listen to your baby's heart
*   probably do an internal examination to find out how much your cervix has opened, so they can then tell how far your labour has progressed – tell your midwife if a contraction is coming before they perform this examination, so that they can wait until it has passed

These checks will be repeated at intervals throughout your labour. Always ask about anything you want to know.

If you and your partner have made a birth plan, show your midwife so they know what you would like to happen during labour.

Delivery rooms
--------------

Most delivery rooms have easy chairs, bean bags and mats, so you can move about in labour and change position. Some have baths, showers or birthing pools. You should feel comfortable in the room where you are giving birth.

Some maternity units may offer you a bath or shower. A warm bath can be soothing in the early stages of labour. You may like to spend much of the labour in the bath, as a way of easing the pain.

Water births
------------

Some maternity units have birthing pools so you can go through labour in water. You may find this helps you to relax.

If labour progresses normally, it may be possible to deliver the baby in the pool. Speak to your midwife about the advantages and disadvantages of a water birth. If you want one, you'll need to make arrangements well in advance.

Title: Inducing labour

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/inducing-labour/

Published Time: 1 Dec 2020, 6:57 p.m.

Markdown Content:
An induced labour is one that's started artificially.

It's common for labour to be induced if your baby is overdue or there's any risk to you or your baby's health.

This risk could be if you have a health condition such as high blood pressure, for example, or your baby is not growing.

Induction will usually be planned in advance. You'll be able to discuss the advantages and disadvantages with your doctor and midwife, and find out why they think your labour should be induced.

It's your choice whether to have your labour induced or not.

If your pregnancy lasts longer than 42 weeks and you decide not to have your labour induced, you should be offered increased monitoring to check your baby's wellbeing.

Why you might be induced
------------------------

*   if you're overdue
*   if your waters have broken
*   if you or your baby have a health problem

### If you're overdue

Induction will be offered if you do not go into labour naturally by 41 weeks, as there will be a higher risk of stillbirth or problems for the baby.

### If your waters break early

If your waters break more than 24 hours before labour starts, there's an increased risk of infection to you and your baby.

If your waters break after 34 weeks, you'll have the choice of induction or expectant management.

Expectant management is when your healthcare professionals monitor your condition and your baby's wellbeing, and your pregnancy can progress naturally as long as it's safe for both of you.

Your midwife or doctor should discuss your options with you before you make a decision.

They should also let you know about the newborn (neonatal) special care hospital facilities in your area.

If your baby is born earlier than 37 weeks, they may be vulnerable to problems related to being premature.

If your waters break before 34 weeks, you'll only be offered induction if there are other factors that suggest it's the best thing for you and your baby.

### If you have a health condition or your baby is not thriving

You may be offered an induction if you have a condition that means it'll be safer to have your baby sooner, such as [diabetes](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/existing-health-conditions/diabetes/), [high blood pressure](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/complications/high-blood-pressure/) or [intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/complications/itching-and-intrahepatic-cholestasis/)

If this is the case, your doctor and midwife will explain your options to you so you can decide whether or not to have your labour induced.

### Membrane sweep

Before inducing labour, you'll be offered a membrane sweep, also known as a cervical sweep, to bring on labour.

A membrane sweep would usually be offered to you after 39 weeks.

To carry out a membrane sweep, your midwife or doctor sweeps their finger around your cervix during an internal examination.

This action should separate the membranes of the amniotic sac surrounding your baby from your cervix. This separation releases hormones (prostaglandins), which may start your labour.

Some women find the procedure uncomfortable or painful. You may get some cramping and vaginal bleeding afterwards.

If labour does not start after a membrane sweep you may be offered an additional sweep or induction of labour.

Induction is always carried out in a hospital maternity unit. You'll be looked after by midwives and doctors will be available if you need their help.

How labour is induced
---------------------

If you're being induced, you'll go into the hospital maternity unit.

There are 2 main ways labour can be induced:

*   Hormones can be put inside your vagina using a vaginal tablet (pessary) or a gel, or given as tablets that you swallow.
*   Devices such as balloon catheter (a small balloon, full of water) or an osmotic dilator (a type of sponge) can be used to widen your cervix.

You’ll usually be offered hormones first to see if they work, unless there’s a medical reason you cannot take hormones.

It usually takes many hours for these treatments to start working. You will usually stay in the hospital maternity unit, though you may be able to go home in some cases.

Sometimes a hormone drip is needed to speed up the labour. You may also need to have your waters broken artificially.

What induced labour feels like
------------------------------

If you need to be induced it may affect where you can give birth. You may need to stay in hospital for longer and have more examinations.

Induced labour is usually more painful than labour that starts on its own.

Your [pain relief options during labour](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/pain-relief-in-labour/) are not restricted by being induced.

You should have access to all the pain relief options usually available, such as an epidural or water birth.

If you are induced you'll be more likely to have an assisted delivery, where [forceps or ventouse suction](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/forceps-or-vacuum-delivery/) are used to help the baby out.

If induction of labour does not work
------------------------------------

Induction is not always successful, and labour may not start.

Your obstetrician and midwife will assess your condition and your baby's wellbeing. You may be offered another method of induction or a caesarean section, or you may be able to wait a few hours and then be assessed again.

Your midwife and doctor will discuss all your options with you.

Natural ways to start labour
----------------------------

There are no proven ways of starting your labour yourself at home.

You may have heard that certain things can trigger labour, such hot baths, certain food or drinks, having sex or herbal supplements. But there's no evidence that these work. Also there’s no information about the safety of herbal supplements and they could be harmful to you or your baby.

Having sex will not cause harm, but you should avoid having sex if your waters have broken as there's an increased risk of infection.

For more information on induction, you can read the [NICE information for the public on induction of labour](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng207/informationforpublic).

Title: Premature labour and birth

Published Time: 1 Dec 2020, 7:12 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Premature labour is labour that happens before the 37th week of pregnancy. About 8 out of 100 babies will be born prematurely.

Urgent advice: Call your midwife or maternity unit if you're less than 37 weeks pregnant and you have:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   regular contractions or tightenings
*   period-type pains
*   a gush or trickle of fluid from your vagina – this could be your waters breaking
*   backache that's not usual for you

You can also call your midwife or maternity unit if you're unsure or worried about anything.

The midwife or hospital will offer checks, tests and monitoring to find out whether:

*   your waters have broken
*   you're in labour
*   you have an infection

These may include a vaginal examination, blood test, urine test and cardiotocography to record contractions and the baby's heartbeat.

They'll need to check you and your baby to find out whether you're in labour and discuss your care choices with you.

Planned premature labour
------------------------

In some cases, pre-term labour is planned and induced because it's safer for the baby to be born sooner rather than later.

This could be because of a health condition in the mother (such as [pre-eclampsia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/)) or in the baby. Your midwife and doctor will discuss with you the benefits and risks of continuing with the pregnancy versus your baby being born premature.

You can still make a birth plan and discuss your wishes with your birth partner, midwife and doctor.

If your waters have broken
--------------------------

If your waters have broken (called preterm pre-labour rupture of membranes, P-PROM), there's an increased risk of infection for you and your baby. You'll be offered:

*   antibiotics to take
*   tests for infection

P-PROM does not definitely mean you're going into labour but you may be advised to stay in hospital for a few days. When you go home, you'll be advised to call your midwife or maternity unit immediately if:

*   your temperature is raised
*   you feel hot and shivery
*   any fluid coming from your vagina is greenish or smelly
*   you bleed from your vagina
*   you have pain in your tummy or back
*   you have contractions
*   your baby's movements slow down or stop or there is a change to their usual pattern of movements

If your pre-term labour is planned or unplanned or if your waters have broken prematurely, you may be offered [steroid injections](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/steroids/).

You'll be offered immediate induction or a [caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/) if:

*   you have P-PROM between weeks 34 and 37 of pregnancy, and
*   a test has found [group B strep](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/group-b-strep/) bacteria in your pee or vagina

If your waters have not broken
------------------------------

Your midwife or doctor should discuss with you the symptoms of pre-term labour and offer checks to see if you're in labour. These checks can include asking you about your medical and pregnancy history, and about possible labour signs, such as:

*   contractions – how strong and how far apart they are
*   any pain
*   any fluid coming from your vagina

You may be offered a vaginal examination, and your pulse, blood pressure and temperature may also be checked.

Your midwife or doctor will also check your baby. They'll probably feel your bump to find out the baby's position and how far into your pelvis the baby's head is.

They should also ask about your baby's movements in the last 24 hours. Tell them if you've noticed any changes.

If you're in premature labour
-----------------------------

The midwife or doctor may offer:

*   medicine to try to slow down or stop your labour
*   steroid injections, which can help your baby's lungs
*   medicine to help protect your baby's brain and nervous system

Slowing down labour or stopping it is not appropriate in all circumstances – your midwife or doctor can discuss your situation with you. They will consider:

*   how many weeks pregnant you are
*   whether it might be safer for the baby to be born – for example, if you have an infection or you're bleeding
*   local neonatal (newborn) care facilities and whether you might need to be moved to another hospital 
*   your wishes

You may be offered a course of steroid injections to help your baby's lungs get ready for breathing if they're born prematurely.

[Steroids](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/steroids/) may not be offered after 36 weeks as your baby's lungs are likely to be ready for breathing on their own.

If you're in premature labour and you're 24 to 29 weeks pregnant you should be offered magnesium sulphate (through a drip). This can help protect your baby's brain development.

You may also be offered it if you're in labour and 30 to 33 weeks pregnant. This is to protect your baby against problems linked to being born too soon, such as cerebral palsy.

If you take magnesium sulphate for more than 5 to 7 days or several times during your pregnancy, your newborn baby may be offered extra checks. This is because prolonged use of magnesium sulphate in pregnancy has in rare cases been linked to bone problems in newborn babies. It's very unlikely that you'll be given magnesium sulphate for more than 24 hours.

Treatment to prevent early labour
---------------------------------

You may be offered treatment to prevent early labour if:

*   you've given birth at less than 34 weeks pregnant before
*   you've had a miscarriage from 16 weeks pregnant before
*   your waters have broken before 37 weeks in a previous pregnancy
*   your cervix has been injured in the past, for example through surgery

You'll usually be offered a vaginal ultrasound scan between 16 and 24 weeks of pregnancy to see if treatment may be helpful. The length of your cervix will also be measured, as having a cervix that is shorter than 25mm has been linked to a higher risk of early labour and birth.

There are 2 treatments that may be offered:

*   a small tablet of hormone medicine that you put into your vagina
*   an operation to put a stitch in your cervix to help support it

Your midwife or doctor will discuss the risks and benefits with you, depending on your circumstances. Treatment usually starts before 24 weeks of pregnancy.

If you have signs of preterm labour, emergency preventative treatment may be considered. Your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits of emergency treatment with you.

What are the risks to my baby of being born early?
--------------------------------------------------

Babies born before full term (before 37 weeks) are vulnerable to problems associated with being born premature. The earlier in the pregnancy a baby is born, the more vulnerable they are.

It's possible for a baby to survive if born around 24 weeks of pregnancy onwards.

Babies born this early need special care in a hospital with specialist facilities for premature babies. This is called a neonatal unit. They may have health and development problems because they have not fully developed in the womb.

If your baby is likely to be delivered early, you should be admitted to a hospital with a neonatal unit.

Not all hospitals have facilities for the care of very premature babies, so it may be necessary to transfer you and your baby to another unit.

Twins and triplets are often born prematurely. Find out about [giving birth to twins](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/giving-birth-to-twins-or-more/).

If you have any reason to think that your labour may be starting early, contact your hospital straight away.

The latent stage of labour is where your cervix starts to soften and open (dilate) so your baby can be born.

You may begin to feel irregular contractions, but it can take many hours, or even days, before you're in established labour. It's usually the longest stage of labour.

At this stage, your contractions may range from being slightly uncomfortable to more painful. There’s no set pattern to how many contractions you get or how long they last.

During the latent stage, it's a good idea to have something to eat and drink because you'll need energy for when labour is established.

If your labour starts at night, try to stay comfortable and relaxed. Sleep if you can.

If your labour starts during the day, stay upright and gently active. This helps your baby move down into your pelvis and helps your cervix to dilate.

Breathing exercises, massage and having a warm bath or shower may help ease pain during this early stage of labour.

Established labour (1st stage of labour)
----------------------------------------

Established labour is where your cervix has dilated to about 4cm and your contractions are stronger and more regular.

### When to contact a midwife

Call your midwife or maternity unit if:

*   your contractions are regular (every 5 minutes or more often)
*   your waters break
*   your contractions are very strong and you feel you need [pain relief](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/pain-relief-in-labour/)
*   you're worried about anything

If you go into hospital before your labour has become established, they may suggest you go home again for a while.

Once labour is established, your midwife will check on you from time to time to see how you're progressing and offer you support, including pain relief if you need it.

You can either walk around or get into a position that feels comfortable to labour in.

Your midwife will offer you regular vaginal examinations to see how your labour is progressing. If you do not want to have these, you do not have to – your midwife can discuss with you why she's offering them.

Your cervix needs to open about 10cm for your baby to pass through it. This is what's called being fully dilated.

In a 1st pregnancy, the time from the start of established labour to being fully dilated is usually 8 to 18 hours. It's often quicker (around 5 to 12 hours), in a 2nd or 3rd pregnancy.

When you reach the end of the 1st stage of labour, you may feel an urge to push.

### Monitoring your baby in labour

Your midwife will monitor you and your baby during labour to make sure you're both coping well.

This will include using a small handheld device to listen to your baby's heart every 15 minutes. You'll be free to move around as much as you want.

Your midwife may suggest electronic monitoring if there are any concerns about you or your baby, or if you choose to have an [epidural](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidural/).

Electronic monitoring involves strapping 2 pads to your bump. One pad is used to monitor your contractions and the other is used to monitor your baby's heartbeat. These pads are attached to a monitor that shows your baby's heartbeat and your contractions

Sometimes a heart monitor called a foetal scalp electrode can be attached to the baby's head instead. This can give a more accurate measurement of your baby's heartbeat.

You can ask to be monitored electronically even if there are no concerns. Having electronic monitoring can sometimes restrict how much you can move around. Your midwife can discuss this with you.

If you have electronic monitoring with pads on your bump because there are concerns about your baby's heartbeat, you can take the monitor off if your baby's heartbeat is shown to be normal.

A foetal scalp electrode will usually only be removed just as your baby is born, not before.

### Speeding up labour

Labour can sometimes be slower than expected. This can happen if your contractions are not coming often enough, are not strong enough, or if your baby is in an awkward position.

If this is the case, your doctor or midwife may talk to you about 2 ways to speed up your labour: breaking your waters or an oxytocin drip.

#### Breaking your waters

Breaking the membrane that contains the fluid around your baby (your waters) is often enough to make contractions stronger and more regular. This is also known as artificial rupture of the membranes (ARM).

Your midwife or doctor can do this by making a small break in the membrane during a vaginal examination. This may make your contractions feel stronger and more painful, so your midwife will talk to you about pain relief.

#### Oxytocin drip

If breaking your waters does not work, your doctor or midwife may suggest using a medicine called oxytocin (also known as syntocinon) to make your contractions stronger. This is given through a drip that goes into a vein, usually in your wrist or arm.

Oxytocin can make your contractions stronger and more regular and can start to work quite quickly, so your midwife will talk to you about your options for pain relief.

You will also need electronic monitoring to check your baby is coping with the contractions, as well as regular vaginal examinations to check the drip is working.

2nd stage of labour
-------------------

The 2nd stage of labour lasts from when your cervix is fully dilated until the birth of your baby.

### Finding a position to give birth in

Your midwife will help you find a comfortable position to give birth in. You may want to sit, lie on your side, stand, kneel, or squat, although squatting may be difficult if you're not used to it.

If you've had lots of backache while in labour, kneeling on all fours may help. It's a good idea to try some of these positions before you go into labour. Talk to your birth partner so they know how they can help you.

Find out [what your birth partner can do](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/tips-for-your-birth-partner/).

### Pushing your baby out

When your cervix is fully dilated, your baby will move further down the birth canal towards the entrance to your vagina. You may get an urge to push that feels a bit like you need to poo.

You can push during contractions whenever you feel the urge. You may not feel the urge to push immediately. If you have had an epidural, you may not feel an urge to push at all.

If you're having your 1st baby, this pushing stage should last no longer than 3 hours. If you've had a baby before, it should take no more than 2 hours.

This stage of labour is hard work, but your midwife will help and encourage you. Your birth partner can also support you.

### What happens when your baby is born

When your baby's head is almost ready to come out, your midwife will ask you to stop pushing and take some short breaths, blowing them out through your mouth.

This is so your baby's head can be born slowly and gently, giving the skin and muscles in the area between your vagina and anus (the perineum) time to stretch.

Sometimes your midwife or doctor will suggest an [episiotomy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/episiotomy-and-perineal-tears/) to avoid a tear or to speed up delivery. This is a small cut made in your perineum.

You'll be given a local anaesthetic injection to numb the area before the cut is made. Once your baby is born, an episiotomy, or any large tears, will be stitched closed.

Find out about [your body after the birth](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/after-the-birth/your-body/), including how to deal with stitches.

Once your baby's head is born, most of the hard work is over. The rest of their body is usually born during the next 1 or 2 contractions.

You'll usually be able to hold your baby immediately and enjoy some skin-to-skin time together.

You can breastfeed your baby as soon as you like. Ideally, your baby will have their 1st feed within 1 hour of birth.

3rd stage of labour
-------------------

The 3rd stage of labour happens after your baby is born, when your womb contracts and the placenta comes out through your vagina.

There are 2 ways to manage this stage of labour:

*   active – when you have treatment to make it happen faster
*   physiological – when you have no treatment and this stage happens naturally

Your midwife will explain both ways to you while you're still pregnant or during early labour, so you can decide which you would prefer.

There are some situations where physiological management is not advisable. Your midwife or doctor can explain if this is the case for you.

### What is active management?

Your midwife will give you an injection of oxytocin into your thigh as you give birth, or soon after. This makes your womb contract.

Evidence suggests it's better not to cut the umbilical cord immediately, so your midwife will wait to do this between 1 and 5 minutes after birth. This may be done sooner if there are concerns about you or your baby – for example, if the cord is wound tightly around your baby's neck.

Once the placenta has come away from your womb, your midwife pulls the cord – which is attached to the placenta – and pulls the placenta out through your vagina. This usually happens within 30 minutes of your baby being born.

Active management speeds up the delivery of the placenta and lowers your risk of having heavy bleeding after the birth (postpartum haemorrhage), but it increases the chance of you feeling and being sick. It can also make afterpains (contraction-like pains after birth) worse.

Read more about [preventing heavy bleeding after birth](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/after-the-birth/what-happens-straight-after/).

### What is physiological management?

No oxytocin injection is given, and the 3rd stage of labour happens naturally.

The cord is not cut until it has stopped pulsing. This means blood is still passing from the placenta to your baby. This usually takes around 2 to 4 minutes.

Once the placenta has come away from your womb, you should feel some pressure in your bottom and you'll need to push the placenta out. It can take up to an hour for the placenta to come away, but it usually only takes a few minutes to push it out.

If the placenta does not come away naturally or you begin to bleed heavily, you'll be advised by your midwife or doctor to switch to active management. You can do this at any time during the 3rd stage of labour.

Whoever your birth partner is – the baby's parent, a close friend, partner, or a relative – there are many practical things they can do to help you.

The most important thing your birth partner can do is just be with you.

Talk to your birth partner about the type of birth you'd like and the things you prefer not to do so they can help support your decisions. It can help to go through your [birth plan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/how-to-make-a-birth-plan/) together.

There's no way of knowing what your [labour](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/the-stages-of-labour-and-birth/) is going to be like or how each of you will cope, but there are many ways a partner can help.

Whatever kind of birth you're planning for, your birth partner can:

*   keep you company and help pass the time during the early stages
*   hold your hand, wipe your face and give you sips of water
*   massage your back and shoulders, and help you move about or change position
*   comfort you as your labour progresses and your contractions get stronger
*   remind you how to use relaxation and breathing techniques, perhaps breathing with you if it helps
*   support your decisions, such as the [pain relief](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/pain-relief-in-labour/) you choose, even if they're different from what's in your birth plan
*   help you explain to the midwife or doctor what you need – and help them communicate with you – which can help you feel more in control of the situation
*   tell you what's happening as your baby is being born if you cannot see what's going on

Your birth partner may be able to cut the umbilical cord – you can talk to your midwife about this.

You can also read about [feelings and relationships in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/support/feelings-and-relationships/), including worries about the birth and [sex in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/sex/).

Make sure you and your birth partner both know [what to pack for the birth](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/pack-your-bag-for-labour/), and [what to expect at the hospital or maternity unit](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/what-happens-at-the-hospital-or-birth-centre/) if you're planning to have your baby there.
