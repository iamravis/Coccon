**Pre-eclampsia is a condition that affects some pregnant women, usually during the second half of pregnancy (from 20 weeks) or soon after their baby is delivered.**

Symptoms of pre-eclampsia
-------------------------

Early signs of pre-eclampsia include having [high blood pressure (hypertension)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/high-blood-pressure-hypertension/) and protein in your urine (proteinuria).

It's unlikely that you'll notice these signs, but they should be picked up during your routine [antenatal appointments](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/antenatal-appointment-schedule/).

In some cases, further symptoms can develop, including:

*   severe headache
*   vision problems, such as blurring or flashing
*   pain just below the ribs
*   vomiting
*   sudden swelling of the face, hands or feet

If you notice any symptoms of pre-eclampsia, seek medical advice immediately by calling your midwife, GP surgery or NHS 111.

Although many cases are mild, the condition can lead to serious complications for both mother and baby if it's not monitored and treated.

The earlier pre-eclampsia is diagnosed and monitored, the better the outlook for mother and baby.

Who's affected?
---------------

There are a number of things that can increase your chances of developing pre-eclampsia, such as:

*   having [diabetes](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetes/), [high blood pressure](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/high-blood-pressure-hypertension/) or [kidney disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/kidney-disease/) before you were pregnant
*   having an autoimmune condition, such as [lupus](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/lupus/) or [antiphospholipid syndrome](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/antiphospholipid-syndrome/)
*   having high blood pressure or pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy

Other things that can slightly increase your chances of developing pre-eclampsia include:

*   a family history of pre-eclampsia
*   being 40 years old or more
*   it's more than 10 years since your last pregnancy
*   expecting multiple babies (twins or triplets)
*   having a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more

If you have 2 or more of these together, your chances are higher.

If you're thought to be at a high risk of developing pre-eclampsia, you may be advised to take a 75 to 150mg daily dose of aspirin from the 12th week of pregnancy until your baby is born.

What causes pre-eclampsia?
--------------------------

Although the exact cause of pre-eclampsia is not known, it's thought to occur when there's a problem with the placenta, the organ that links the baby's blood supply to the mother's.

Treating pre-eclampsia
----------------------

If you're diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, you should be referred for an assessment by a specialist, usually in hospital.

While in hospital, you'll be monitored closely to determine how severe the condition is and whether a hospital stay is needed.

The only way to cure pre-eclampsia is to deliver the baby, so you'll usually be monitored regularly until it's possible for your baby to be delivered.

This will normally be at around 37 to 38 weeks of pregnancy, but it may be earlier in more severe cases.

At this point, labour may be started artificially [(induced)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/induction-labour/) or you may have a [caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/).

You'll be offered medicine to lower your blood pressure while you wait for your baby to be delivered.

Complications
-------------

Although most cases of pre-eclampsia cause no problems and improve soon after the baby is delivered, there's a risk of serious complications that can affect both the mother and her baby.

There's a risk that the mother will develop fits called "eclampsia". These fits can be life threatening for the mother and baby, but they're rare.

Title: Gestational diabetes

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gestational-diabetes/

Published Time: 20 Oct 2017, 11:02 a.m.

Markdown Content:
**Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar (glucose) that develops during pregnancy and usually disappears after giving birth.**

It can happen at any stage of pregnancy, but is more common in the second or third trimester.

It happens when your body cannot produce enough insulin – a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels – to meet your extra needs in pregnancy.

Gestational diabetes can cause problems for you and your baby during pregnancy and after birth. But the risks can be reduced if the condition is detected early and well managed.

Who's at risk of gestational diabetes
-------------------------------------

Any woman can develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy, but you're at an increased risk if:

*   you are over 40
*   your body mass index (BMI) is above 30 – use the [BMI healthy weight calculator](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/) to work out your BMI
*   you previously had a baby who weighed 4.5kg (10lb) or more at birth
*   you had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy
*   1 of your parents or siblings has diabetes
*   you are of south Asian, Black, African-Caribbean or Middle Eastern origin (even if you were born in the UK)
*   you have had a gastric bypass or other weight-loss surgery

If any of these apply to you, you should be offered screening for gestational diabetes during your pregnancy.

Symptoms of gestational diabetes
--------------------------------

Gestational diabetes does not usually cause any symptoms.

Most cases are only discovered when your blood sugar levels are tested during screening for gestational diabetes.

Some women may develop symptoms if their blood sugar levels gets too high [(hyperglycaemia)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/high-blood-sugar-hyperglycaemia/), such as:

*   increased [thirst](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/thirst/)
*   needing to pee more often than usual
*   a dry mouth
*   tiredness
*   blurred eyesight
*   genital itching or thrush

But some of these symptoms are common during pregnancy and are not necessarily a sign of gestational diabetes. Speak to your midwife or doctor if you're worried about any symptoms you're experiencing.

How gestational diabetes can affect your pregnancy
--------------------------------------------------

Most women with gestational diabetes have otherwise normal pregnancies with healthy babies.

However, gestational diabetes can cause problems such as:

*   your baby growing larger than usual – this may lead to difficulties during the delivery and increases the likelihood of needing [induced labour](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/inducing-labour/) or a [caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/)
*   [polyhydramnios](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/polyhydramnios/) – too much amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the baby) in the womb, which can cause premature labour or problems at delivery
*   [premature birth](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/premature-labour-and-birth/) – giving birth before the 37th week of pregnancy
*   [pre-eclampsia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/) – a condition that causes high blood pressure during pregnancy and can lead to pregnancy complications if not treated
*   your baby developing low blood sugar or yellowing of the skin and eyes ([jaundice](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/jaundice-newborn/causes/)) after he or she is born, which may require treatment in hospital
*   the loss of your baby ([stillbirth](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stillbirth/)) – though this is rare

Having gestational diabetes also means you're at an increased risk of developing [type 2 diabetes](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/type-2-diabetes/) in the future.

Screening for gestational diabetes
----------------------------------

During your [first antenatal appointment](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/your-antenatal-appointments/) (also called a booking appointment) at around week 8 to 12 of your pregnancy, your midwife or doctor will ask you some questions to determine whether you're at an increased risk of gestational diabetes.

If you have 1 or more risk factors for gestational diabetes you should be offered a screening test.

The screening test is called an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which takes about 2 hours.

It involves having a [blood test](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-tests/) in the morning, when you have not had any food or drink for 8 to 10 hours (though you can usually drink water, but check with the hospital if you're unsure). You're then given a glucose drink.

After resting for 2 hours, another blood sample is taken to see how your body is dealing with the glucose.

The OGTT is done when you're between 24 and 28 weeks pregnant. If you've had gestational diabetes before, you'll be offered an OGTT earlier in your pregnancy, soon after your booking appointment, then another OGTT at 24 to 28 weeks if the first test is normal.

Treatments for gestational diabetes
-----------------------------------

If you have gestational diabetes, the chances of having problems with your pregnancy can be reduced by controlling your blood sugar levels.

You'll be given a blood sugar testing kit so you can monitor the effects of treatment.

Blood sugar levels may be reduced by changing your diet and being more active if you can. Gentle activities such as walking, swimming and prenatal yoga can help reduce blood sugar. But tell your midwife or doctor before starting an activity you haven’t done before.

However, if these changes don't lower your blood sugar levels enough, you will need to take medicine as well. This may be tablets or insulin injections.

You'll also be more closely monitored during your pregnancy and birth to check for any potential problems.

If you have gestational diabetes, it's best to give birth before 41 weeks. Induction of labour or a caesarean section may be recommended if labour does not start naturally by this time.

Earlier delivery may be recommended if there are concerns about your or your baby's health or if your blood sugar levels have not been well controlled.

Find out more about [how gestational diabetes is treated](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gestational-diabetes/treatment/).

Long-term effects of gestational diabetes
-----------------------------------------

Gestational diabetes normally goes away after birth. But women who've had it are more likely to develop:

*   gestational diabetes again in future pregnancies
*   [type 2 diabetes](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/type-2-diabetes/) – a lifelong type of diabetes

You should have a blood test to check for diabetes 6 to 13 weeks after giving birth, and once every year after that if the result is normal.

See your GP if you develop symptoms of high blood sugar, such as increased thirst, needing to pee more often than usual, and a dry mouth – do not wait until your next test.

You should have the tests even if you feel well, as many people with diabetes do not have any symptoms.

You'll also be advised about things you can do to reduce your risk of getting diabetes, such as maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly.

Some research has suggested that babies of mothers who had gestational diabetes may be more likely to develop diabetes or become [obese](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/obesity/) later in life.

Planning future pregnancies
---------------------------

If you've had gestational diabetes before and you're planning to get pregnant, make sure you get checked for diabetes. Your GP can arrange this.

If you do have diabetes, you should be referred to a diabetes pre-conception clinic for support to ensure your condition is well controlled before you get pregnant.

Read more about [diabetes in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/existing-health-conditions/diabetes/).

If you have an unplanned pregnancy, talk to your GP and tell them you had gestational diabetes in your previous pregnancy.

If tests show you do not have diabetes, you'll be offered screening earlier in pregnancy (soon after your first midwife appointment) and another test at 24 to 28 weeks if the first test is normal.

Alternatively, your midwife or doctor may suggest you test your blood sugar levels yourself using a finger-pricking device in the same way as you did during your previous gestational diabetes.

Title: Caesarean section

Published Time: 19 Oct 2017, 3:59 p.m.

Markdown Content:
**A caesarean section, or C-section, is an operation to deliver your baby through a cut made in your tummy and womb.**

The cut is usually made across your tummy, just below your bikini line.

A caesarean is a major operation that carries a number of risks, so it's usually only done if it's the safest option for you and your baby.

Around 1 in 4 pregnant women in the UK has a caesarean birth.

Why caesareans are carried out
------------------------------

A caesarean may be recommended as a planned (elective) procedure or done in an emergency if it's thought a vaginal birth is too risky.

Planned caesareans are usually done from the 39th week of pregnancy.

A caesarean may be carried out because:

*   your baby is in the [breech position](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/if-your-baby-is-breech/) (feet first) and your doctor or midwife has been unable to turn them by applying gentle pressure to your tummy, or you'd prefer they did not try this
*   you have a [low-lying placenta](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/placenta-complications/) (placenta praevia)
*   you have pregnancy-related high blood pressure ([pre-eclampsia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/))
*   you have certain infections, such as a first [genital herpes](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/genital-herpes/) infection occurring late in pregnancy or untreated [HIV](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids/)
*   your baby is not getting enough oxygen and nutrients – sometimes this may mean the baby needs to be delivered immediately
*   your labour is not progressing or there's excessive vaginal bleeding

If there's time to plan the procedure, your midwife or doctor will discuss the benefits and risks of a caesarean compared with a vaginal birth.

Asking for a caesarean
----------------------

Some women choose to have a caesarean for non-medical reasons.

If you ask your midwife or doctor for a caesarean when there are not medical reasons, they'll explain the overall benefits and risks of a caesarean to you and your baby compared with a vaginal birth.

If you're anxious about giving birth, you should be offered the chance to discuss your anxiety with a healthcare professional who can offer support during your pregnancy and labour.

If after discussing all the risks and hearing about all the support on offer you still feel that a vaginal birth is not an acceptable option, you should be offered a planned caesarean. If your doctor is unwilling to perform the operation, they should refer you to a doctor who will.

What happens during a caesarean
-------------------------------

Most caesareans are carried out under spinal or [epidural anaesthetic](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidural/).

This mean you'll be awake, but the lower part of your body is numbed so you will not feel any pain.

During the procedure:

*   a screen is placed across your body so you cannot see what's being done – the doctors and nurses will let you know what's happening
*   a cut about 10 to 20cm long will usually be made across your lower tummy and womb so your baby can be delivered
*   you may feel some tugging and pulling during the procedure
*   you and your birth partner will be able to see and hold your baby as soon as they have been delivered if they're well – a baby born by emergency caesarean because of foetal distress may be taken straight to a paediatrician for resuscitation

The whole operation normally takes about 40 to 50 minutes.

Occasionally, a [general anaesthetic](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/general-anaesthesia/) (where you're asleep) may be used, particularly if the baby needs to be delivered more quickly.

Recovering from a caesarean
---------------------------

Recovering from a caesarean usually takes longer than recovering from a vaginal delivery.

Providing there are no complications, most women can go home 1 to 2 days after having a caesarean.

You may experience some discomfort in your tummy for the first few days. You'll be offered painkillers to help with this.

When you go home, you'll need to take things easy at first. You may need to avoid some activities, such as driving, until you have had your postnatal check-up with the doctor at 6 weeks.

The wound in your tummy will eventually form a scar. This may be obvious at first, but it should fade with time and will often be hidden in your pubic hair.

[Find out more about recovering from a caesarean](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/recovery/)

Risks of a caesarean
--------------------

A caesarean is generally a very safe procedure, but like any type of surgery it carries a certain amount of risk.

It's important to be aware of the possible complications, particularly if you're considering having a caesarean for non-medical reasons.

Possible complications include:

*   infection of the wound or womb lining
*   [blood clots](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-clots/)
*   excessive bleeding
*   damage to nearby areas, such as the bladder or the tubes that connect the kidneys and bladder
*   temporary breathing difficulties in your baby
*   accidentally cutting your baby when your womb is opened

[Find out more about the risks of a caesarean](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/risks/)

Future pregnancies after a caesarean
------------------------------------

If you have a baby by caesarean, it does not necessarily mean that any babies you have in the future will also have to be delivered this way.

Most women who have had a caesarean section can safely have a vaginal delivery for their next baby, known as vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC).

But you may need some extra monitoring during labour just to make sure everything is progressing well.

Some women may be advised to have another caesarean if they have another baby.

This depends on whether a caesarean is still the safest option for them and their baby.
