    "query": "Why is it important to maintain a balanced diet during pregnancy? Provide detailed reasons and examples.",
    "answer": "Maintaining a balanced diet during pregnancy ensures that both the mother and baby receive all the essential nutrients needed for proper development. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, proteins, and whole grains supports the baby's growth and helps prevent complications such as low birth weight or developmental issues. Nutrients like folic acid help prevent neural tube defects, while iron supports increased blood volume. Additionally, a balanced diet can help the mother maintain her energy levels and reduce the risk of gestational diabetes. It's important to avoid empty calories and focus on nutrient-dense foods.

    "context": "A healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle at any time but is especially\u00a0vital\u00a0if you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Eating healthily during pregnancy will help your baby to develop and grow.\n\nYou do not need to go on a special diet, but it's important to eat a variety of different foods every day to get the right balance of nutrients that you and your baby need.\n\nIt's best to get vitamins and minerals from the foods you eat, but when you're pregnant you need to take\u00a0a folic acid\u00a0supplement as well, to make sure you get everything you need.\n\nRead more about [vitamins and supplements in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/vitamins-supplements-and-nutrition/).\n\nThere are also [certain foods that should be avoided in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/foods-to-avoid/).\n\nThere's no need to \"eat for 2\"\n------------------------------\n\nYou will probably find that you are more hungry than usual, but you do not need to \"eat for 2\" \u2013 even if you are expecting twins or triplets.\n\nTry to have a healthy breakfast every day, because this can help\u00a0you to avoid snacking on foods that are high in fat and sugar.\n\nEating healthily often means changing the amounts of different foods you eat, so that\u00a0your diet is varied,\u00a0rather than cutting out all your favourites. You can use the [Eatwell Guide](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-guidelines-and-food-labels/the-eatwell-guide/)\u00a0to get the balance of your diet right. It shows you how much of what you eat should come from each food group to achieve a healthy, balanced diet.\n\nYou do not need to achieve this balance with every meal, but try to get the balance right over a week.\n\nFruit\u00a0and vegetables in pregnancy\n---------------------------------\n\nEat plenty of fruit and vegetables because these provide vitamins and minerals, as well as fibre, which helps digestion and can help prevent [constipation](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/constipation/).\n\nEat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day \u2013 these can include fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced. Always wash\u00a0fresh fruit and vegetables\u00a0carefully.\n\n[Find out what counts as a portion of fruit or vegetables](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/5-a-day/portion-sizes/).\n\nStarchy foods (carbohydrates) in pregnancy\n------------------------------------------\n\n[Starchy foods](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/starchy-foods-and-carbohydrates/) are an important source of energy, some vitamins and fibre, and help you to feel full without containing too many calories. They include bread, potatoes, breakfast cereals, rice, pasta, noodles, maize, millet, oats, yams and cornmeal. If you are having chips, go for oven chips lower in fat and salt.\n\nThese foods should make up just over a 3rd of the food you eat. Instead of refined starchy (white) food, choose wholegrain or higher-fibre options such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or simply leaving the skins on potatoes.\n\nProtein in pregnancy\n--------------------\n\nEat some protein-rich foods every day.

There are some types of fish you should avoid when you're pregnant or planning to get pregnant, including shark, swordfish and marlin.\n\nWhen you're pregnant, you should avoid having more than 2 portions of oily fish a week, such as salmon, trout, mackerel and herring, because it can contain pollutants (toxins).\n\nYou should avoid eating some raw or partially cooked eggs, as there is a risk of salmonella.\n\nEggs produced under the British Lion Code of Practice are safe for pregnant women to eat raw or partially cooked, as they come from flocks that have been vaccinated against salmonella.\n\nThese eggs have a red lion logo stamped on their shell. Pregnant women can eat these raw or partially cooked (for example, soft boiled eggs).\n\nEggs that have not been produced under the Lion Code are considered less safe, and pregnant women are advised to avoid eating them raw or partially cooked, including in mousse, mayonnaise and souffl\u00e9.

This can cause an infection called [listeriosis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/listeriosis/).\n\nListeriosis can lead to [miscarriage](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/miscarriage/) or [stillbirth](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stillbirth/), or make your newborn baby very unwell.\n\nSoft cheeses with a white coating on the outside have more moisture.

This can be harmful to an unborn baby.\n\nGame meats may contain lead shot.\n\nEggs\n\n### What you can eat\n\n*   raw, partially cooked and fully cooked British Lion hen eggs (they have a lion stamp on them) and hen eggs produced under the Laid in Britain scheme\n*   foods made with raw hen egg, such as mousse and mayonnaise, if made with British Lion eggs or hen eggs produced under the Laid in Britain scheme\n*   well cooked eggs (white and yolk) from any hen eggs that are not British Lion eggs or produced under the Laid in Britain scheme\n*   well cooked eggs (white and yolk) of all other eggs, including duck, goose or quail\n\n### What to avoid\n\n*   raw or partially cooked hen eggs that are not British Lion or produced under the Laid in Britain scheme\n*   raw or partially cooked duck, goose or quail eggs\n\n### Why\n\nBritish Lion hen eggs and hen eggs produced under the Laid in Britain scheme are less likely to have salmonella in them.\n\nSalmonella is unlikely to harm your unborn baby, but you could get [food poisoning](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/food-poisoning/).\n\nYou should cook all eggs thoroughly, unless they are British Lion hen eggs or hen eggs produced under the Laid in Britain scheme.\n\nFish\n\n### What you can eat\n\n*   cooked fish and seafood\n*   sushi, as long as the fish has been cooked thoroughly\n*   cooked shellfish, such as mussels, lobster, crab, prawns, scallops and clams\n\n### What to limit\n\n*   you should eat no more than 2 portions of oily fish a week, such as salmon, trout, mackerel or herring\n*   you should eat no more than 2 tuna steaks (about 140g cooked or 170g raw) or 4 medium-size cans of tuna (about 140g when drained) per week\n\nInformation:\n\n#### Tuna does not count as an oily fish\n\nYou can have 2 tuna steaks, or 4 medium-size cans of fish, as well as 2 portions of oily fish a week.\n\n### What to avoid\n\n*   swordfish\n*   marlin\n*   shark\n*   raw shellfish\n*   cold-smoked or cured fish (for example smoked salmon or gravlax, including in sushi), unless it has been cooked until steaming hot\n\n### Why\n\nYou should avoid ready-to-eat cold-smoked or cured fish because it could be contaminated with listeria bacteria. These bacteria can cause an infection called listeriosis, which can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth, or make your newborn baby seriously ill. Cooking smoked or cured fish until it's steaming hot will kill any bacteria that may be present.\n\nYou should limit tuna because it has more mercury in it than other fish. If you eat too much mercury, it can be harmful to your unborn baby.\n\nYou should limit oily fish because they can have pollutants such as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls in them. If you eat too much of these, they can be harmful to your unborn baby.\n\nYou should avoid raw shellfish because they can have harmful bacteria, viruses or toxins in them. These can make you unwell and give you food poisoning.\n\nOther foods and drinks\n\n### Caffeine\n\nYou can have caffeine, but no more than 200mg per day. Regularly drinking more than this amount can increase your risk of pregnancy complications, such as low birthweight, and even miscarriage.\n\nThere is:\n\n*   100mg in a mug of instant coffee\n*   140mg in a mug of filter coffee\n*   75mg in a mug of tea (green tea can have the same amount of caffeine as regular tea)\n*   40mg in a can of cola\n*   80mg in a 250ml can of energy drink\n*   less than 25mg in a 50g bar of plain dark chocolate\n*   less than 10mg in a 50g bar of plain milk chocolate\n\n### Herbal teas\n\nThe caffeine content can vary quite widely between different brands of herbal tea. Some contain no caffeine, while others may have quite high levels.\n\nCheck the ingredients label on the packet to see how much caffeine is in a brand. Some of the herbs used in herbal tea can also be potentially dangerous if you have a lot of them during pregnancy; especially during weeks 1 to 12 (first trimester).\n\nAs a general rule, if you drink no more than 1 to 2 cups of herbal tea a day during your pregnancy, you should be fine.\n\n### Alcohol\n\nDrinking [alcohol in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/drinking-alcohol-while-pregnant/) can lead to long-term harm to your baby.\n\nIf you're pregnant or planning to get pregnant, the safest approach is to not drink alcohol at all.\n\nThis keeps risks to your baby to a minimum.\n\n### Liquorice\n\nLiquorice is safe to eat. But you should avoid liquorice root.\n\n### Fruits, vegetables and salads\n\nBe careful with fruits, vegetables and salads as they can have soil on them, which can make you unwell.\n\nMake sure to thoroughly wash all fruits, vegetables and salad ingredients.\n\n### Peanuts\n\nYou do not need to avoid eating peanuts when you're pregnant.\n\nOnly avoid eating peanuts if you're advised to by a healthcare professional, or if you have a nut allergy.\n\n### Vitamins\n\nDo not take high-dose multivitamin supplements, or any supplements with vitamin A in them.\n\nGet Better Health's Start for Life pregnancy and baby emails\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSign up for [Start for Life weekly emails](https://www.nhs.uk/start4life/signups/new) for expert advice, videos and tips on pregnancy, birth and beyond.\n\n\n==================================================\n\nContent from https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/vitamins-supplements-and-nutrition/:",

It's recommended pregnant and breastfeeding women take a daily supplement containing this amount between September and March.\n\nVitamin D regulates the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body, which are needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy. Our bodies make vitamin D when our skin is exposed to summer sunlight (from late March/early April to the end of September)\n\nBetween the months of September and March the body cannot make sufficient vitamin D from sunlight alone, which is why a supplement is recommended.\n\nVitamin D is also in some foods, including:\n\n*   oily fish (such as salmon, mackerel, herring and sardines)\n*   eggs\n*   red meat\n\nVitamin D is also added to some breakfast cereals, fat spreads and non-dairy milk alternatives. The amounts added to these products can vary and might only be small.\n\nBecause vitamin D is only found in a small number of foods, whether naturally occurring or added, it is difficult to get enough from foods alone.\n\nDo not take more than 100 micrograms (4,000 IU) of vitamin D a day as it could be harmful.\n\nYou can get vitamin supplements containing vitamin D free of charge if you're pregnant or breastfeeding and qualify for the [Healthy Start scheme](https://www.healthystart.nhs.uk/).\n\nInformation:\n\nThere have been some reports about vitamin D reducing the risk of coronavirus (COVID-19). But there is currently not enough evidence to support taking vitamin D solely to prevent or treat COVID-19.\n\n### If you have dark skin or cover your skin a lot\n\nYou may be at particular risk of not having enough vitamin D if:\n\n*   you have dark skin (for example, if you're of African, African Caribbean or south Asian origin)\n*   you cover your skin when outside or spend lots of time indoors\n\nYou may need to consider taking a daily supplement of vitamin D all year. Talk to a midwife or doctor for advice.\n\nIron\u00a0in pregnancy\n-----------------\n\nIf you do not have enough iron, you'll probably get very tired and may suffer from [anaemia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/iron-deficiency-anaemia/).\n\nLean meat, green leafy vegetables, dried fruit and nuts contain iron.\n\nIf you'd like to eat peanuts or foods that contain peanuts (such as peanut butter) during pregnancy, you can do so as part of a healthy, balanced diet unless you're allergic to them or your health professional advises you not to.\n\nMany breakfast cereals have iron added to them. If the iron level in your blood becomes low, a GP or midwife will advise you to take iron supplements.\n\nVitamin C\u00a0in pregnancy\n----------------------\n\nVitamin C protects cells and helps keep them healthy.\n\nIt's found in a wide variety of fruit and vegetables, and a balanced diet can provide all the vitamin C you need.\n\nGood sources include:\n\n*   oranges and orange juice\n*   red and green peppers\n*   strawberries\n*   blackcurrants\n*   broccoli\n*   brussels sprouts\n*   potatoes\n\nCalcium\u00a0in pregnancy\n--------------------\n\nCalcium is vital for making your baby's bones and teeth.\n\nSources of calcium include:\n\n*   milk, cheese and yoghurt\n*   green leafy vegetables, such as rocket, watercress or curly kale\n*   tofu\n*   soya drinks with added calcium\n*   bread and any foods made with fortified flour\n*   fish where you eat the bones, such as sardines and pilchards\n\nVegetarian, vegan and special diets in pregnancy\n------------------------------------------------\n\nA varied and balanced vegetarian diet should provide enough nutrients for you and your baby during pregnancy.\n\nBut you might find it more difficult to get enough iron and vitamin B12.\n\nTalk to a midwife or doctor about how to make sure you're getting enough of these important nutrients.\n\nIf you're vegan or you follow a restricted diet because of a food intolerance (for example, a gluten-free diet for coeliac disease) or for religious reasons, talk to a midwife or GP.\n\nAsk to be referred to a dietitian for advice on how to make sure you're getting all the nutrients you need for you and your baby.\n\n[Find out more about healthy eating if you're pregnant and vegetarian or vegan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/vegetarian-or-vegan-and-pregnant/)\n\nHealthy Start vitamins\n----------------------\n\nThe\u202fHealthy Start scheme may be able to help you buy food and milk if you're pregnant or have a child under 4 years old and receive certain benefits, or you\u2019re pregnant and under 18.\n\nIf you're eligible, you'll be sent a Healthy Start card which you can use to buy certain types of milk, infant formula, fruit and vegetables.\n\nYou can also use your card to get free vitamins.\n\nIf you're not eligible for the Healthy Start scheme, some NHS organisations still offer the vitamins for free, or sell them.

If the iron level in your blood becomes low, a GP or midwife will advise you to take iron supplements.\n\nVitamin C\u00a0in pregnancy\n----------------------\n\nVitamin C protects cells and helps keep them healthy.\n\nIt's found in a wide variety of fruit and vegetables, and a balanced diet can provide all the vitamin C you need.\n\nGood sources include:\n\n*   oranges and orange juice\n*   red and green peppers\n*   strawberries\n*   blackcurrants\n*   broccoli\n*   brussels sprouts\n*   potatoes\n\nCalcium\u00a0in pregnancy\n--------------------\n\nCalcium is vital for making your baby's bones and teeth.\n\nSources of calcium include:\n\n*   milk, cheese and yoghurt\n*   green leafy vegetables, such as rocket, watercress or curly kale\n*   tofu\n*   soya drinks with added calcium\n*   bread and any foods made with fortified flour\n*   fish where you eat the bones, such as sardines and pilchards\n\nVegetarian, vegan and special diets in pregnancy\n------------------------------------------------\n\nA varied and balanced vegetarian diet should provide enough nutrients for you and your baby during pregnancy.\n\nBut you might find it more difficult to get enough iron and vitamin B12.\n\nTalk to a midwife or doctor about how to make sure you're getting enough of these important nutrients.\n\nIf you're vegan or you follow a restricted diet because of a food intolerance (for example, a gluten-free diet for coeliac disease) or for religious reasons, talk to a midwife or GP.\n\nAsk to be referred to a dietitian for advice on how to make sure you're getting all the nutrients you need for you and your baby.\n\n[Find out more about healthy eating if you're pregnant and vegetarian or vegan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/vegetarian-or-vegan-and-pregnant/)\n\nHealthy Start vitamins\n----------------------\n\nThe\u202fHealthy Start scheme may be able to help you buy food and milk if you're pregnant or have a child under 4 years old and receive certain benefits, or you\u2019re pregnant and under 18.\n\nIf you're eligible, you'll be sent a Healthy Start card which you can use to buy certain types of milk, infant formula, fruit and vegetables.\n\nYou can also use your card to get free vitamins.\n\nIf you're not eligible for the Healthy Start scheme, some NHS organisations still offer the vitamins for free, or sell them.

    "answer": "Maintaining a balanced diet during pregnancy ensures that both the mother and baby receive all the essential nutrients needed for proper development. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, proteins, and whole grains supports the baby's growth and helps prevent complications such as low birth weight or developmental issues. Nutrients like folic acid help prevent neural tube defects, while iron supports increased blood volume. Additionally, a balanced diet can help the mother maintain her energy levels and reduce the risk of gestational diabetes. It's important to avoid empty calories and focus on nutrient-dense foods.

    "answer": "Maintaining a balanced diet during pregnancy ensures that both the mother and baby receive all the essential nutrients needed for proper development. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, proteins, and whole grains supports the baby's growth and helps prevent complications such as low birth weight or developmental issues. Nutrients like folic acid help prevent neural tube defects, while iron supports increased blood volume. Additionally, a balanced diet can help the mother maintain her energy levels and reduce the risk of gestational diabetes. It's important to avoid empty calories and focus on nutrient-dense foods.

The risk of\u00a0[miscarriage](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/miscarriage/) is also higher in the first 3 months, whether you're travelling or not.\n\nTravelling in the final months of pregnancy can be tiring and uncomfortable. So, many women find the best time to travel or take a holiday is in mid-pregnancy, between 4 and 6 months.\n\nFlying\u00a0in pregnancy\n-------------------\n\nFlying isn't harmful to you or your baby, but discuss any health issues or pregnancy complications with your midwife or doctor before you fly.\n\nThe chance of going into labour is naturally higher after\u00a0[37 weeks](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/week-by-week/28-to-40-plus/37-weeks/) (around 32 weeks if you're carrying twins), and some airlines won't let you fly towards the end of your pregnancy. Check with the airline for their policy on this.\n\nAfter week 28 of pregnancy, the airline may ask for a letter from your doctor or midwife confirming your due date, and that you are not at risk of complications. You may have to pay for the letter and wait several weeks before you get it.\n\nLong-distance travel (longer than 4 hours) carries a small risk of blood clots [(deep vein thrombosis (DVT))](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/). If you fly, drink plenty of water and move about regularly \u2013 every 30 minutes or so. You can buy a pair of graduated compression or\u00a0support stockings\u00a0from the pharmacy, which will help\u00a0reduce leg swelling.\n\nTravel vaccinations when you're pregnant\n----------------------------------------\n\nMost vaccines that use live bacteria or viruses aren't recommended during pregnancy because of concerns that they could harm the baby in the womb.\n\nHowever, some live travel vaccines may be considered during pregnancy if the risk of infection outweighs the risk of live vaccination. Ask your GP or midwife for advice about specific travel vaccinations.

However, if it can't be avoided, make sure you stop regularly and get out of the car to stretch and move around.\n\nYou can also do some exercises in the car (when you're not driving), such as flexing and rotating your feet and wiggling your toes. This will keep the blood flowing through your legs and reduce any stiffness and discomfort. Wearing compression stockings while on long car journeys (more than 4 hours) can also increase the blood flow in your legs and help prevent blood clots.\n\nTiredness and dizziness are common during pregnancy so it's important on car journeys\u00a0to drink regularly and eat natural, energy-giving foods, such as fruit and nuts.\n\nKeep the air circulating in the car and wear your seatbelt with the cross strap between your breasts and the lap strap across your pelvis\u00a0under your bump,\u00a0not across your bump.\n\nRoad accidents are among the most common causes of injury in pregnant women.

    "query": "Why should pregnant women avoid 'eating for two'?",
    "answer": "The idea of 'eating for two' is a myth. While you may need to increase your calorie intake slightly during pregnancy, it's more important to focus on the quality of the foods you eat, rather than the quantity. Excessive calorie intake can lead to unnecessary weight gain, which may cause complications like gestational diabetes or high blood pressure. A healthy diet with nutrient-dense foods is key."

This will keep the blood flowing through your legs and reduce any stiffness and discomfort. Wearing compression stockings while on long car journeys (more than 4 hours) can also increase the blood flow in your legs and help prevent blood clots.\n\nTiredness and dizziness are common during pregnancy so it's important on car journeys\u00a0to drink regularly and eat natural, energy-giving foods, such as fruit and nuts.\n\nKeep the air circulating in the car and wear your seatbelt with the cross strap between your breasts and the lap strap across your pelvis\u00a0under your bump,\u00a0not across your bump.\n\nRoad accidents are among the most common causes of injury in pregnant women.

There will be a stop smoking programme you can join.\n\nPassive smoking (breathing in smoke from other people's cigarettes) is also harmful in pregnancy, so avoid being around people who are smoking if you can.\n\nIf your partner or someone else in your household smokes, they can contact NHS stop smoking services for support in quitting.\n\n[Find out about stopping smoking in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/stop-smoking/)\n\nAvoid alcohol in pregnancy\n--------------------------\n\nThe safest way to ensure your baby is not damaged by alcohol is not to drink\u00a0while you're\u00a0pregnant.\n\nIf you're finding it hard to stop drinking, ask for help from your midwife or GP.\n\n[Find out about alcohol and pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/drinking-alcohol-while-pregnant/)\n\nGo to sleep on your side\n------------------------\n\nResearch suggests that going to sleep on your back after 28 weeks of pregnancy doubles the risk of stillbirth.\n\nIt's thought this may be to do with the flow of blood and oxygen to the baby.\n\nThe safest option is to fall asleep on your side, either left or right. Do not worry if you wake up on your back, just turn on to your side to go back to sleep.\n\n[Find out about sleep position in pregnancy on the Tommy's website](https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/im-pregnant/sleep-side/sleep-position-pregnancy-qa)\n\nTell your midwife about any drug use\n------------------------------------\n\nUsing illegal drugs during pregnancy could harm your baby. If you use or have used illegal drugs (such as cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy or heroin) or other substances, tell your midwife or doctor.\n\nThe more\u00a0your midwife\u00a0knows about your general health, the better\u00a0she or he\u00a0will be able to help you and your baby.\n\nDo not be afraid to share this information. It'll be treated in\u00a0confidence and only shared with other relevant professionals if the midwife thinks it's in the best interests of you and your baby.\n\n[Find out about illegal drugs and pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/illegal-drugs/)\n\nHave the flu jab\n----------------\n\nMake sure you have\u00a0the seasonal flu vaccination, which is available\u00a0from early autumn each year.\n\nPregnant women are more at risk from flu complications, such as bronchitis and pneumonia,\u00a0than the general population. These complications can harm your baby.\n\nYour midwife or GP will offer you\u00a0the flu jab \u2013 it's free and safe to have at any stage of pregnancy.\n\nWomen who have\u00a0had the vaccine\u00a0in pregnancy\u00a0also pass some protection on to their babies, which lasts for the first few months of the baby's life.\n\n[Find out about the flu jab in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/flu-jab/)\n\nAvoid people who are ill\n------------------------\n\nWherever possible, avoid contact with people who have signs of infectious illnesses, including diarrhoea, high temperature and being sick (vomiting).\n\nYou should also avoid children (as well as adults) who have been diagnosed with \"childhood illnesses\" (infections most common in childhood) like chickenpox, measles, or parvovirus (slapped cheek syndrome).\n\nIf you have been or are in contact with someone with an infection, speak to your midwife or GP for advice.\n\n[Find out about infections in pregnancy that may affect your baby](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/infections-that-may-affect-your-baby/)\n\nWash your hands\n---------------\n\nBe strict about good hygiene wherever you are.

This includes raw or undercooked meat, some cheeses, and unpasteurised milk.\n\nYou should also avoid caffeine or limit it to no more than 200mg a day. Caffeine is in foods and drinks such as coffee, tea, energy drinks, cola and chocolate.\n\nGet to know which [foods to avoid while you're pregnant](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/foods-to-avoid/).\n\nWhen to get medical help\n------------------------\n\n### Urgent advice: Contact your maternity unit or call 111 immediately if:\n\n*   your baby's movements have reduced, changed or stopped\n*   you have bleeding from your vagina\n*   you have stomach (abdominal) pain\n*   you have unusual vaginal discharge or fluid\n*   you have swelling, blurred vision or severe headache\n*   you have itching anywhere on your body, possibly worse at night\n\n### Your baby's movements have reduced\n\nCall your midwife or maternity unit straight away if:\n\n*   your baby is moving less than usual\n*   you cannot feel your baby moving anymore\n*   there is a change to your baby's usual pattern of movements\n\nThey'll need to check your baby's movements and heartbeat.\n\nDo not wait until the next day, or your next appointment or after the weekend \u2013 call your midwife straightaway, even if it's the middle of the night.\n\nDo not use a home monitoring kit (such as a doppler) to try to check the baby's heartbeat yourself.\n\nThis is not a reliable way to check your baby's health. Even if you hear a heartbeat, this does not mean your baby is well.\n\n[Find out more about baby movements in pregnancy on the Tommy's website](https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/pregnancy-symptom-checker/baby-fetal-movements)\n\n### You bleed from your vagina\n\nVaginal bleeding may indicate a problem \u2013 read about [bleeding from your vagina in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/pregnancy/what-causes-bleeding-during-pregnancy/).\n\n### You have vaginal discharge that is not normal for you\n\nIf you have watery, clear or coloured discharge or fluid from your vagina that seems abnormal for you, contact your maternity unit.

    "query": "Why should pregnant women avoid 'eating for two'?",
    "answer": "The idea of 'eating for two' is a myth. While you may need to increase your calorie intake slightly during pregnancy, it's more important to focus on the quality of the foods you eat, rather than the quantity. Excessive calorie intake can lead to unnecessary weight gain, which may cause complications like gestational diabetes or high blood pressure. A healthy diet with nutrient-dense foods is key."

Safe exercises include walking, swimming, and prenatal yoga, all of which are low-impact and gentle on the body.
