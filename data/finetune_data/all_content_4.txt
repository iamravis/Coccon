Your body has a great deal to do during pregnancy. Sometimes the changes taking place can cause irritation or discomfort, and sometimes you may be concerned.

There's rarely any need for alarm, but you should mention anything that's worrying you to your maternity team.

Constipation in pregnancy
-------------------------

The hormonal changes in your body may cause you to become constipated very early on in your pregnancy.

To help prevent constipation, you can:

*   eat foods that are high in fibre, such as wholemeal breads and cereals, fruit and vegetables, and pulses such as beans and lentils – read more about [having a healthy diet in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/have-a-healthy-diet/)
*   exercise regularly to keep your muscles toned – read more about [exercise in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/exercise/)
*   drink plenty of water
*   avoid iron supplements, which can make you constipated – ask your doctor if you can either manage without them or change to a different type

You can read more about [constipation](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/constipation/), including symptoms and treatment.

Cramp in pregnancy
------------------

Cramp is a sudden, sharp pain, usually in your calf muscles or feet. It's most common at night.

Regular gentle exercise in pregnancy, particularly ankle and leg movements, will improve your circulation and may help prevent cramp. Try these foot exercises:

*   bend and stretch your foot vigorously up and down 30 times
*   rotate your foot 8 times one way and 8 times the other way
*   repeat with the other foot

It may help to ease cramp if you pull your toes hard up towards your ankle or rub the muscle hard.

Feeling faint in pregnancy
--------------------------

You may feel faint while pregnant. This is usually due to hormonal changes. [Fainting](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/fainting/) happens if your brain is not getting enough blood and, therefore, not enough oxygen.

You are most likely to feel faint if you stand up too quickly from a chair or out of a bath, but it can also happen when you are lying on your back.

Here are some tips to help avoid feeling faint:

*   try to get up slowly after sitting or lying down
*   if you feel faint when standing still, find a seat quickly and the faintness should pass – if it does not, lie down on your side
*   if you feel faint while lying on your back, turn onto your side

It's better not to lie flat on your back in later pregnancy or during labour. You should avoid going to sleep on your back after 28 weeks as it has been linked to a higher risk of stillbirth.

Feeling hot in pregnancy
------------------------

You're likely to feel warmer than usual during pregnancy. This is due to hormonal changes and an increase in blood supply to the skin. You're also likely to sweat more.

It can help if you:

*   wear loose clothing made of natural fibres, as these are more absorbent and breathable than synthetic fibres
*   keep your room cool – you could use an electric fan
*   wash frequently to help you feel fresh

Incontinence in pregnancy
-------------------------

[Incontinence](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/urinary-incontinence/) is a common problem during and after pregnancy. You might be unable to prevent a sudden spurt of pee when you cough, laugh, sneeze, move suddenly or just get up from a sitting position.

This may be temporary, because the pelvic floor muscles (the muscles around the bladder) relax slightly to prepare for the baby's delivery. There are [exercises](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/exercise/) you can do to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.

If you have a problem, talk to your midwife, doctor or health visitor.

Peeing a lot in pregnancy
-------------------------

Needing to pee a lot often starts in early pregnancy and sometimes continues until the baby is born. In later pregnancy, it's caused by the baby's head pressing on your bladder.

If you find you need to get up in the night to pee, try cutting out drinks in the late evening. However, make sure you drink plenty of non-alcoholic, caffeine-free drinks during the day to stay hydrated.

Later in pregnancy, you may find it helps to rock backwards and forwards while you’re on the toilet. This lessens the pressure of the womb on the bladder so you can empty it properly.

If you have any pain while peeing or you pass any blood in your pee, you may have a urine infection, which will need treatment.

Drink plenty of water to dilute your pee and reduce pain. You should contact your GP within 24 hours of noticing these symptoms. Read more about [urinary tract infections (UTIs)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/urinary-tract-infections-utis/).

Don't take any medicines without asking your midwife, doctor or pharmacist whether they're safe in pregnancy.

Skin changes in pregnancy
-------------------------

Hormonal changes taking place in pregnancy may make your nipples and the area around them go darker. Your skin colour may also darken a little, either in patches or all over.

[Birthmarks](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/birthmarks/), [moles](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/moles/) and freckles may also darken. You may develop a dark line down the middle of your stomach. These changes will gradually fade after the baby is born, although your nipples may remain a little darker.

If you sunbathe while pregnant, you may find you burn more easily. Protect your skin with a high-factor sunscreen and don't stay in the sun for a long time. Read more about [sunscreen and sun safety](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/seasonal-health/sunscreen-and-sun-safety/).

Varicose veins in pregnancy
---------------------------

[Varicose veins](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/varicose-veins/) are veins that have become swollen. They can be uncomfortable but aren't harmful.

Varicose veins most commonly affect the legs, but you can also get them in the vaginal opening (vulva). They usually get better after the birth.

If you have varicose veins, you should:

*   avoid standing for long periods of time
*   try not to sit with your legs crossed
*   try not to put on too much weight, as this increases the pressure – read more about [weight gain in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/weight-gain/)
*   sit with your legs up as often as you can to ease the discomfort
*   try compression stockings, which you can buy at most pharmacies – they won't prevent varicose veins but can ease the symptoms
*   try sleeping with your legs higher than the rest of your body – use pillows under your ankles or put books under the foot of your bed
*   do foot and other [antenatal exercises](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/exercise/), such as walking and swimming, which will help your circulation

Try these foot exercises:

*   bend and stretch your foot up and down 30 times
*   rotate your foot 8 times one way and 8 times the other
*   repeat with the other foot

**It is very common to get backache or back pain during pregnancy, especially in the early stages.**

During pregnancy, the ligaments in your body naturally become softer and stretch to prepare you for labour. This can put a strain on the joints of your lower back and pelvis, which can cause back pain.

Avoiding and easing back pain in pregnancy
------------------------------------------

Try these tips:

*   bend your knees and keep your back straight when you lift or pick something up from the floor
*   avoid lifting heavy objects
*   move your feet when you turn to avoid twisting your spine
*   wear flat shoes to evenly distribute your weight
*   try to balance the weight between 2 bags when carrying shopping
*   keep your back straight and well supported when sitting – look for maternity support pillows
*   get enough rest, particularly later in pregnancy
*   have a massage or a warm bath
*   use a mattress that supports you properly – you can put a piece of hardboard under a soft mattress to make it firmer, if necessary
*   go to a group or individual back care class

You can take paracetamol to ease back pain while you are pregnant, unless your GP or midwife says not to. Always follow the instructions on the packet.

When to get help for back pain in pregnancy
-------------------------------------------

If your backache is very painful, talk to your GP or midwife. They may be able to refer you to an obstetric physiotherapist at your hospital, who can give you advice and may suggest some helpful exercises.

### Non-urgent advice: Contact your GP or midwife urgently if:

You have back pain and you:

*   are in your second or third trimester – this could be a sign of early labour
*   also have a fever, bleeding from your vagina or pain when you pee
*   have pain in one or more of your sides (under your ribs)

### Immediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if:

You have back pain and:

*   you lose feeling in one or both of your legs, your bum, or your genitals

Exercises to ease back pain in pregnancy
----------------------------------------

This gentle exercise helps to strengthen stomach (abdominal) muscles, which can ease back pain in pregnancy:

![Image 1: An image of someone on their hands and knees.](https://assets.nhs.uk/nhsuk-cms/images/A_0218_pregnancy-back-pain-exercise_BTHBG4.width-320.jpg)

1) Start on all fours with knees under hips, hands under shoulders, fingers facing forwards and stomach muscles lifted to keep your back straight.

![Image 2: An image of someone on their hands and knees while lifting their back up and rolling their head down.](https://assets.nhs.uk/nhsuk-cms/images/A_0218_pregnancy-back-pain-exercise2_BTHBG4.width-320.jpg)

2) Pull in your stomach muscles and raise your back up towards the ceiling, letting your head and bum relax downwards gently – do not let your elbows lock and only move your back as far as you comfortably can.

![Image 3: An image of someone on their hands and knees.](https://assets.nhs.uk/nhsuk-cms/images/A_0218_pregnancy-back-pain-exercise_BTHBG4.width-320.jpg)

3) Hold for a few seconds then slowly return to the box position – take care not to hollow your back, it should always return to a straight, neutral position.

4) Do this slowly and rhythmically 10 times, making your muscles work hard and moving your back carefully.

Doing [prenatal yoga](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/nhs-fitness-studio/pilates-and-yoga/prenatal-and-postnatal-exercise/) or aquanatal classes (gentle exercise classes in water) with a qualified instructor can also help build your muscles to better support your back. Ask at your local leisure centre.

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/bleeding-gums/

Published Time: 3 Dec 2020, 9:45 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Some women get swollen and sore gums, which may bleed, during pregnancy. Bleeding gums are caused by a build-up of plaque on the teeth.

Hormonal changes during pregnancy can make your gums more vulnerable to plaque, leading to inflammation and bleeding. This is also called pregnancy gingivitis or gum disease.

Find out about [treating gum disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gum-disease/)

Your dentist will be able to help with this. NHS dental care is free during pregnancy and for the first year after the birth of your baby.

To get free dental care, you need to apply for a maternity exemption certificate (MatEx). Ask your doctor, nurse or midwife for form FW8. You complete parts 1 and 2 of the form, and your doctor, midwife or nurse signs it to confirm that the information you've given is correct.

[Find an NHS dentist near you](https://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Dentist/LocationSearch/3)

Keeping teeth and gums healthy in pregnancy
-------------------------------------------

It's very important to keep your teeth and gums clean and healthy while you're pregnant. The best way to prevent or deal with gum problems is to practise good oral hygiene.

Go to the dentist so they can give your teeth a thorough clean and show you how to keep your teeth clean at home.

Here's how you can look after your teeth and gums:

*   Clean your teeth carefully twice a day for 2 minutes with a fluoride toothpaste – ask your dentist to show you a good brushing method to remove plaque.
*   Floss once a day to remove small bits of food from between your teeth, which will help to prevent the build-up of plaque.
*   Brushing is best with a small-headed toothbrush with soft filaments – make sure it's comfortable to hold.
*   Avoid having sugary drinks (such as fizzy drinks or sweet tea) and sugary foods too often – try to keep them to meal times.
*   If you're hungry between meals, snack on foods such as vegetables, fresh fruit or plain yoghurt, and avoid sugary or acidic foods.
*   Avoid mouthwashes that contain alcohol.
*   Stop smoking, as it can make gum disease worse.

If you have [morning sickness](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/vomiting-and-morning-sickness/) (nausea and vomiting), rinse your mouth with plain water after each time you are sick. This will help prevent the acid in your vomit from damaging your teeth.

Do not brush your teeth straight away as they will be softened by the acid from your stomach. Wait about an hour before brushing.

Find out more about the [symptoms of gum disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gum-disease/symptoms/).

Dental treatments to avoid in pregnancy
---------------------------------------

When you go to the dentist, make sure they know you're pregnant.

Discuss with your dentist whether any new or replacement fillings should be delayed until after your baby is born. The Department of Health and Social Care advises that amalgam fillings should not be removed during pregnancy.

If you need a dental [X-ray](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/x-ray/), your dentist will usually wait until you've had your baby, even though most dental X-rays do not affect the tummy (abdomen) or pelvic area.

Find out more about [caring for your teeth and gums](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-teeth-and-gums/take-care-of-your-teeth-and-gums/), including check-ups and brushing.

Headaches in pregnancy
======================

Headaches can be common in early pregnancy. They usually improve as your pregnancy goes on.

They do not harm your baby, but they can be uncomfortable for you.

A headache can sometimes be a symptom of [pre-eclampsia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/), which can lead to serious complications if it's not monitored and treated. Pre-eclampsia usually starts after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Urgent advice: Call your maternity unit, GP or NHS 111 if you have:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

*   a severe headache
*   problems with vision, such as blurring or seeing flashing lights
*   pain just below your ribs
*   vomiting
*   a sudden increase in swelling of your face, hands, feet or ankles

Any of these could be signs of [pre-eclampsia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/) and need to be checked immediately.

Coping with headaches in pregnancy
----------------------------------

[Paracetamol](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/paracetamol-for-adults/) is the first choice of painkiller if you're pregnant.

However, for safety, if you take paracetamol in pregnancy, take it for the shortest possible time.

You can get advice from your pharmacist, midwife or GP about how much paracetamol you can take and for how long.

There are some painkillers you should avoid in pregnancy – such as those containing codeine, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen – unless prescribed by your doctor.

You can also make changes to your lifestyle to try and help prevent and treat headaches. Try to:

*   drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration
*   get enough sleep – read about [tiredness and sleep problems in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/tiredness/)
*   rest and relax – you could try a pregnancy yoga class, for example

Title: Indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/indigestion-and-heartburn/

Published Time: 3 Dec 2020, 1:55 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Indigestion, also called [heartburn or acid reflux](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heartburn-and-acid-reflux/), is common in pregnancy. It can be caused by hormonal changes and the growing baby pressing against your stomach.

You can help ease indigestion and heartburn by making changes to your diet and lifestyle, and there are medicines that are safe to take in pregnancy.

Symptoms of indigestion and heartburn
-------------------------------------

Symptoms of indigestion and heartburn include:

*   a burning sensation or pain in the chest
*   feeling full, heavy or bloated
*   burping or belching
*   feeling or being sick
*   bringing up food

Symptoms usually come on soon after eating or drinking, but there can sometimes be a delay between eating and getting indigestion.

You can get symptoms at any point during your pregnancy, but they are more common from 12 weeks onwards.

Things you can do to help with indigestion and heartburn
--------------------------------------------------------

Changes to your diet and lifestyle may be enough to control your symptoms, particularly if they are mild.

### Eat healthily

You're more likely to get indigestion if you're very full.

If you're pregnant, it may be tempting to eat more than you would normally, but this may not be good for you or your baby.

Find out more about a [healthy diet in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/have-a-healthy-diet/) and [foods to avoid in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/foods-to-avoid/).

### Change your eating and drinking habits

You may be able to control your indigestion with changes to your eating habits.

It can help to eat small meals often, rather than larger meals 3 times a day, and to not eat within 3 hours of going to bed at night.

Sit up straight when you eat and just after eating. This will take the pressure off your stomach.

Cutting down on drinks containing caffeine, and foods that are rich, spicy or fatty, can also ease symptoms.

### Sleeping position

Propping your head and shoulders up when you go to bed can stop stomach acid coming up while you sleep.

Sleeping on your left side can also help.

### Stop smoking

Smoking when pregnant can cause indigestion, and can seriously affect the health of you and your unborn baby.

When you smoke, the chemicals you inhale can contribute to your indigestion. These chemicals can cause the ring of muscle at the lower end of your gullet to relax, which allows stomach acid to come back up more easily. This is known as acid reflux.

Smoking also increases the risk of:

*   your baby being born prematurely (before week 37 of your pregnancy)
*   your baby being born with a low birthweight
*   [sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-sids/), or "cot death"

There's lots of help available to stop smoking. Talk to your midwife or call the NHS Smokefree helpline on 0300 123 1044.

[Find out more about stopping smoking in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/stop-smoking/)

### Avoid alcohol

Drinking alcohol can cause indigestion. During pregnancy, it can also lead to long-term harm to the baby. It's safest to not drink alcohol at all in pregnancy.

[Find out more about alcohol and pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/drinking-alcohol-while-pregnant/)

When to get medical help
------------------------

See your midwife or GP if you need help managing your symptoms or if changes to your diet and lifestyle do not work. They may recommend medicine to ease your symptoms.

You should also see your midwife or GP if you have any of the following:

*   difficulty swallowing
*   a hoarse voice
*   a cough that does not get better or keeps coming back
*   swollen glands on each side of your neck
*   weight loss
*   pain or swelling in your stomach

Your midwife or GP may ask about your symptoms and examine you by pressing gently on different areas of your chest and stomach to see whether it's painful.

### If you're taking prescription medicines

Speak to your GP if you're taking medicine for another condition, such as antidepressants, and you think it may be making your indigestion worse. They may be able to prescribe an alternative medicine.

Never stop taking a prescribed medicine unless you're advised to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional who's responsible for your care.

Medicines for indigestion and heartburn
---------------------------------------

Medicines for indigestion and heartburn during pregnancy include:

*   [antacids](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/antacids/) to neutralise the acid in your stomach – you can get some types from a pharmacist (tell them you're pregnant as some antacids are not suitable during pregnancy)
*   alginates to relieve indigestion caused by acid reflux by stopping the acid in your stomach coming back up your gullet

You may only need to take antacids and alginates when you start getting symptoms. However, your GP may recommend taking them before symptoms come on – for example, before a meal or before bed.

Do not take antacids within 2 hours of taking folic acid or iron supplements. Antacids can stop these supplements from being absorbed by your body.

If antacids and alginates do not improve your symptoms, your GP may prescribe another medicine to reduce the amount of acid in your stomach.

Causes of indigestion in pregnancy
----------------------------------

You get symptoms of indigestion when the acid in your stomach irritates your stomach lining or gullet. This causes pain and a burning feeling.

When you're pregnant, you're more likely to have indigestion because of:

*   hormonal changes
*   the growing baby pressing on your stomach
*   the muscles between your stomach and gullet relaxing, allowing stomach acid to come back up

You may be more likely to get indigestion in pregnancy if:

*   you had indigestion before you were pregnant
*   you've been pregnant before
*   you're in the later stages of pregnancy

Leaking from your nipples
=========================

Some women notice leaking from their nipples during pregnancy, and this is normal.

In pregnancy, the breasts may start to produce milk weeks or months before you are due to have your baby.

If your nipples are leaking, the substance is usually colostrum, which is the first milk your breasts make in preparation for feeding your baby. Leaking is normal and nothing to worry about.

If it bothers you, you can try putting a tissue or an absorbent breast pad (sometimes called maternity breast pads, or nursing pads) in your bra to absorb the milk. Breast pads are available in some pharmacies and mother and baby shops.

After your baby is born and if you're breastfeeding, your breasts will probably leak milk. You can learn more about breastfeeding, including how to deal with [common breastfeeding problems](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/breastfeeding-and-bottle-feeding/breastfeeding-problems/common-problems/) and [expressing and storing breast milk](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/breastfeeding-and-bottle-feeding/breastfeeding/expressing-breast-milk/).

When to get help
----------------

If the milk leaking from your breasts has blood in it, talk to your midwife or GP.

It usually takes several weeks for your breasts to completely stop producing milk after you stop breastfeeding. Some women continue to produce milk up to 2 years after they have stopped breastfeeding.

Contact your GP if you've stopped breastfeeding and:

*   you're still producing a lot of milk
*   your milk stopped but then started again

Nosebleeds in pregnancy
=======================

Nosebleeds are quite common in pregnancy because of hormonal changes and because there's more blood moving through your body.

They can be frightening, but there's nothing to worry about as long as you don't lose a lot of blood, and they can often be treated at home.

During a nosebleed, blood flows from one or both nostrils. It can be heavy or light and last from a few seconds to more than 10 minutes.

Nosebleeds can happen when you're asleep. You might feel liquid in the back of your throat before blood comes out of your nose if you're lying down.

During pregnancy, you may also find that your nose gets more blocked up than usual.

**How to stop a nosebleed**
---------------------------

*   Sit down and firmly pinch the soft part of your nose, just above your nostrils, for 10 to 15 minutes without releasing the pressure.
*   Lean forward and breathe through your mouth. This will drain blood down your nose instead of down the back of your throat.
*   Sit or stand upright, rather than lying down, as this reduces the blood pressure in the veins of your nose and will discourage further bleeding.
*   Holding a covered ice pack, or a packet of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel, on the top of your nose may help reduce blood flow. But the evidence to show it works is not very strong.

If the bleeding doesn't stop, seek medical advice – call your midwife or GP urgently.

Avoid blowing your nose, bending down and strenuous activity for at least 24 hours after a nosebleed.

Talk to your midwife or GP if you're worried about your nosebleeds.

Title: Pelvic pain in pregnancy

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/pelvic-pain/

Published Time: 3 Dec 2020, 2:25 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Some women may develop pelvic pain in pregnancy. This is sometimes called pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PGP) or symphysis pubis dysfunction (SPD).

PGP is a collection of uncomfortable symptoms caused by a stiffness of your pelvic joints or the joints moving unevenly at either the back or front of your pelvis.

Symptoms of PGP
---------------

PGP is not harmful to your baby, but it can be painful and make it hard to get around.

Women with PGP may feel pain:

*   over the pubic bone at the front in the centre, roughly level with your hips
*   across 1 or both sides of your lower back
*   in the area between your vagina and anus (perineum)
*   spreading to your thighs

Some women may feel or hear a clicking or grinding in the pelvic area.

The pain can be worse when you're:

*   walking
*   going up or down stairs
*   standing on 1 leg (for example, when you're getting dressed)
*   turning over in bed
*   moving your legs apart (for example, when you get out of a car)

Most women with PGP can have a vaginal birth.

### Non-urgent advice: Call your midwife or GP if you have pelvic pain and:

*   it's hard for you to move around
*   it hurts to get out of a car or turn over in bed
*   it's painful going up or down stairs

These can be signs of pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain.

Treatments for PGP
------------------

Getting diagnosed as early as possible can help keep pain to a minimum and avoid long-term discomfort.

You may be referred to a physiotherapy service that specialises in obstetric pelvic joint problems.

Physiotherapy aims to relieve or ease pain, improve muscle function, and improve your pelvic joint position and stability.

This may include:

*   exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor, stomach, back and hip muscles
*   equipment, if necessary, such as crutches or pelvic support belts

These problems tend not to get completely better until the baby is born, but treatment from an experienced practitioner can improve the symptoms during pregnancy.

Coping with pelvic pain in pregnancy
------------------------------------

Your physiotherapist may recommend a pelvic support belt to help ease your pain, or crutches to help you get around.

There are some things you can do to help ease pelvic and lower back pain in pregnancy.

Try to:

*   keep active but avoid doing things that make the pain worse
*   rest when you can
*   wear supportive shoes
*   put equal weight on each leg when standing
*   sit down when getting dressed or undressed
*   put a pillow between your legs for extra support in bed
*   keep your knees together when getting in and out of the car

You should also avoid:

*   sitting or standing for long periods
*   going up and down stairs too often
*   lifting heavy objects, such as shopping bags

The physiotherapist should be able to provide advice on coping with the emotional impact of living with chronic pain, such as using relaxation techniques.

If your pain is causing you considerable distress, then you should let your GP or midwife know. You may require additional treatment.

[Find out more about pelvic girdle pain and pregnancy on the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) website](https://www.rcog.org.uk/for-the-public/browse-all-patient-information-leaflets/pelvic-girdle-pain-and-pregnancy/)

Labour and birth with pelvic pain
---------------------------------

Many women with pelvic pain in pregnancy can have a normal vaginal birth.

Plan ahead and talk about your [birth plan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/how-to-make-a-birth-plan/) with your birth partner and midwife.

Write in your birth plan that you have PGP, so the people supporting you during labour and birth will be aware of your condition.

Think about birth positions that are the most comfortable for you, and write them in your birth plan.

Being in water can take the weight off your joints and allow you to move more easily, so you might want to think about having a water birth. You can discuss this with your midwife.

Who gets pelvic pain in pregnancy?
----------------------------------

It's estimated that PGP affects up to 1 in 5 pregnant women to some degree.

It's not known exactly why pelvic pain affects some women, but it's thought to be linked to a number of issues, including previous damage to the pelvis, pelvic joints moving unevenly, and the weight or position of the baby.

Factors that may make a woman more likely to develop PGP include:

*   a history of lower back or pelvic girdle pain
*   previous injury to the pelvis (for example, from a fall or accident)
*   having PGP in a previous pregnancy
*   a physically demanding job
*   being overweight

Piles in pregnancy
==================

Symptoms of piles
-----------------

Piles, also known as [haemorrhoids](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/piles-haemorrhoids/), are swellings containing enlarged blood vessels inside or around your bottom (the rectum and anus).

Anyone can get piles – they don't just happen in pregnancy.

Symptoms of piles can include:

*   itching, aching, soreness or swelling around your anus
*   pain when passing a stool (faeces, poo) and a mucus discharge afterwards
*   a lump hanging outside the anus
*   bleeding after passing a stool – the blood is usually bright red

How to ease piles
-----------------

Constipation can cause piles. If this is the cause, try to keep your stools soft and regular by eating plenty of food that's high in fibre.

This includes:

*   wholemeal bread
*   fruit
*   vegetables

Drinking plenty of water can help, too.

[Find out more about a healthy diet in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/have-a-healthy-diet/).

Other things you can try include:

*   avoid standing or sitting for long periods
*   take regular exercise to help relieve constipation
*   use a cloth wrung out in iced water to ease the pain – hold it gently against the piles
*   avoid straining to pass a stool, as this may make your piles worse
*   after passing a stool, clean your anus with moist toilet paper instead of dry toilet paper
*   pat, rather than rub, the area

There are medicines that can help soothe the inflammation around your anus. These treat the symptoms, but not the cause, of piles.

Ask your doctor, midwife or pharmacist if they can suggest a suitable treatment to help soothe the area. Don't use a cream or medicine without checking with them first.

Title: Stomach pain in pregnancy

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/stomach-pain/

Published Time: 3 Dec 2020, 2:42 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Stomach (abdominal) pains or cramps are common in pregnancy. They're usually nothing to worry about, but they can sometimes be a sign of something more serious that needs to be checked.

It's probably nothing to worry about if the pain is mild and goes away when you change position, have a rest, do a poo or pass wind. But if you have stomach pains and are worried, call your midwife or maternity hospital.

Harmless stomach pains, which can be dull or sharp, may be caused by:

*   ligament pain (often called "growing pains" as the ligaments stretch to support your growing bump) – this can feel like a sharp cramp on one side of your lower tummy
*   constipation – which is common in pregnancy (find out [how to avoid constipation](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/common-health-problems/))
*   trapped wind

Urgent advice: Call your midwife immediately if you have stomach pain and:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   bleeding or spotting
*   regular cramping or tightenings
*   vaginal discharge that's unusual for you
*   lower back pain
*   pain or burning when you pee
*   the pain is severe or does not go away after you've rested for 30 to 60 minutes

Any of these could be the symptoms of something that needs to be checked or treated urgently.

Possible causes of serious stomach pain
---------------------------------------

Some conditions that can cause stomach pain need to be checked urgently.

### Ectopic pregnancy

This is when a fertilised egg implants outside the womb, for example in a fallopian tube. The pregnancy cannot survive and needs to be removed with medicine or surgery.

Symptoms typically appear between 4 and 12 weeks of pregnancy and can include:

*   tummy pain and bleeding
*   pain in the tip of your shoulder
*   discomfort when pooing or peeing

### Miscarriage

Cramping pains and bleeding before 24 weeks of pregnancy can sometimes be a sign of [miscarriage](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/miscarriage/) or threatened miscarriage (when you bleed but the pregnancy normally continues).

### Pre-eclampsia

Pain just under the ribs is common in later pregnancy due to the growing baby and uterus pushing up under the ribs.

But if this pain is bad or persistent, particularly on the right side, it can be a sign of pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure in pregnancy) which affects some pregnant women. It usually starts after 20 weeks or just after the baby is born.

Other symptoms of pre-eclampsia include:

*   severe headache
*   vision problems
*   swollen feet, hands and face

You'll need to be monitored in hospital.

[Find out more about pre-eclampsia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/)

### Premature labour

If you're less than 37 weeks pregnant and are having regular abdominal cramps or tightenings, call your midwife.

This could be a sign of [premature labour](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/premature-labour-and-birth/), and you'll need to be monitored in hospital.

### Placental abruption

This is when the placenta starts to come away from the wall of the womb, usually causing bleeding and constant severe pain that does not come and go like a contraction pain.

It's sometimes an emergency because it means the placenta may not be able to support your baby properly.

You should go to the hospital so you and your baby can be checked.

[Find out more about placental abruption](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/pregnancy/what-complications-can-affect-the-placenta/)

### UTI (urinary tract infection)

UTIs are common in pregnancy and can usually be easily treated. They can cause tummy pain and sometimes, but not always, pain when you pee.

Pregnancy stretch marks
-----------------------

![Image 1: Close-up of a person’s tummy showing a number of red lines (stretch marks) on their skin. The image shown is on white skin.](https://assets.nhs.uk/nhsuk-cms/images/A625RY.width-320.jpg)

Stretch marks on light brown skin

Stretch marks are narrow, streak-like lines that can develop on the surface of the skin. They can be pink, red, purple or brown, depending on your skin colour. They are common in pregnancy, affecting around 8 out of 10 pregnant women.

They usually appear on your tummy, or sometimes on your upper thighs and breasts, as your pregnancy progresses and your bump starts to grow. When stretch marks appear will be different from woman to woman.

The first sign you notice might be itchiness around an area where the skin is becoming thinner.

Stretch marks are not harmful. They do not cause medical problems and there is no specific treatment for them.

After your baby is born, the marks may gradually fade into paler scars and become less noticeable. They probably will not go away completely.

What causes stretch marks?
--------------------------

Stretch marks are very common and do not just affect pregnant women.

They can happen whenever the skin is stretched, for example during puberty or when putting on weight. Hormonal changes in pregnancy can affect your skin and make you more likely to get stretch marks.

They happen when the middle layer of skin (dermis) becomes stretched and broken in places.

Whether or not you get stretch marks depends on your skin type, as some people's skin is more elastic.

Pregnancy weight gain
---------------------

You are more likely to get stretch marks if your weight gain is more than average in pregnancy. Most women gain about 10 to 12.5kg (22 to 28lb) in pregnancy, although weight gain varies a great deal from woman to woman.

How much weight you gain may depend on your weight before you were pregnant.

It's important not to try to lose weight when you're pregnant by eating less. You need to have a [healthy diet during pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/have-a-healthy-diet/).

If you are worried about your weight, talk to your midwife or GP. They may give you advice if you weigh more than 100kg (about 15.5st) or less than 50kg (about 8st).

Preventing stretch marks
------------------------

Some creams claim to remove stretch marks once they've appeared, but there is no reliable evidence that they work. There is also limited evidence about whether oils or creams help prevent stretch marks from appearing in the first place.

Find out more about [stretch marks](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stretch-marks/), including possible treatments for them.

Markdown Content:
It's normal to get some swelling in pregnancy, particularly in your legs, ankles, feet and fingers.

It's often worse at the end of the day and further into your pregnancy.

Swelling that comes on gradually is not usually harmful to you or your baby, but it can be uncomfortable.

A sudden increase in swelling can be a sign of [pre-eclampsia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/), a condition that needs to be monitored as soon as possible.

Urgent advice: Call your midwife, GP or labour ward immediately if you have:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   a sudden increase in swelling in your face, hands or feet
*   a very bad headache
*   problems with your vision, such as blurring or flashing lights in your eyes
*   severe pain just below your ribs
*   heartburn that does not go away when you take antacid medicine
*   feeling very unwell
*   feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)

These could be symptoms of pre-eclampsia, which can lead to serious complications if it's not monitored and treated.

Normal pregnancy swelling
-------------------------

Swelling is caused by your body holding more water than usual when you're pregnant.

Throughout the day the extra water tends to gather in the lowest parts of the body, especially if the weather is hot or you have been standing a lot.

The pressure of your growing womb can also affect the blood flow in your legs. This can cause fluid to build up in your legs, ankles and feet.

What can help to reduce swelling
--------------------------------

Try to:

*   avoid standing for long periods
*   wear comfortable shoes and socks – avoid tight straps or anything that might pinch if your feet swell
*   try to rest with your feet up as much as you can
*   exercise – try to take regular walks during the day or doing foot exercises

### Foot exercises

You can do foot exercises sitting or standing. They improve blood circulation, reduce swelling in the ankles, and prevent cramp in the calf muscles:

*   bend and stretch your foot up and down 30 times
*   rotate each foot in a circle 8 times one way and 8 times the other way

Is it normal to feel tired in pregnancy?
----------------------------------------

It's common to feel tired, or even exhausted, during pregnancy, especially in the first 12 weeks.

Hormonal changes at this time can make you feel tired, nauseous and emotional. The only answer is to rest as much as possible.

Make time to sit with your feet up during the day, and accept any offers of help from colleagues and family.

Being tired and run-down can make you feel low. Try to look after your physical health – make sure you eat a [healthy diet](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/have-a-healthy-diet/), and get plenty of rest and sleep.

Later in pregnancy, you may feel tired because of the extra weight you're carrying. Make sure you get plenty of rest.

As your bump gets bigger, it can be difficult to get a good night's sleep. You might find that lying down is uncomfortable or that you need to use the loo a lot.

Feeling tired will not harm you or your baby, but it can make life feel more difficult, especially in the early days before you've told people about your pregnancy.

Strange dreams during pregnancy
-------------------------------

You may have strange dreams or nightmares about the baby, and about [labour and birth](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/). This is normal.

Talking about them with your partner or midwife can help. Remember, just because you dream something, it does not mean it's going to happen. Relaxation and breathing techniques may be helpful in reducing any anxiety you might be feeling.

Bump-friendly sleep positions 
------------------------------

The safest position to go to sleep is on your side, either left or right. Research suggests that, after 28 weeks, falling asleep on your back can double the risk of stillbirth. This may be to do with the flow of blood and oxygen to the baby.

Do not worry if you wake up on your back, you can turn over and go to sleep again on your side.

You can try supporting your bump with pillows and putting a pillow between your knees.

[Watch a video about safer sleeping in pregnancy on the Tommy's charity website](https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/sleep-side/sleep-side-late-pregnancy-campaign-film).

Insomnia remedies in pregnancy
------------------------------

Try to relax before bedtime so you're not wide awake. Relaxation techniques may also help, ask your midwife for advice. Your [antenatal classes](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/antenatal-classes/) may teach you some techniques, or you could use a pregnancy relaxation CD or DVD.

It’s best not to nap in the afternoon or evening as this may mean you’re not tired at bedtime.

Avoid tea, coffee or cola drinks in the evening, as the caffeine can make it harder to go to sleep.

You could join an antenatal yoga or pilates class. Make sure the instructor knows you're pregnant. Exercise can help you feel less tired, so try to do some activity, such as a walk at lunchtime or going swimming, even if you feel tired during the day.

If lack of sleep is bothering you, talk to your partner, a friend, doctor or midwife.

Insomnia in pregnancy and depression
------------------------------------

Occasionally, sleeplessness – when accompanied by other symptoms – can be a sign of depression. If you have any of the other [symptoms of depression](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/depression-in-adults/symptoms/), such as feeling hopeless and losing interest in the things you used to enjoy, speak to your doctor or midwife.

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/thrush/

Published Time: 3 Dec 2020, 9:28 p.m.

Markdown Content:
During pregnancy, women can get thrush because of the changes going on in the body, especially during the third trimester. But there's no evidence that thrush can harm an unborn baby.

What is thrush?
---------------

[Thrush](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/thrush-in-men-and-women/) is a yeast infection caused by the Candida species of fungus, usually Candida albicans. It lives in the vagina of some people without causing any harm or symptoms, because its growth is kept under control by normal bacteria.

But if the balance of bacteria changes – for example, because you're pregnant, taking [antibiotics](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/antibiotics/) or the combined contraceptive pill – the fungus can grow and cause:

*   white discharge (like cottage cheese), which does not usually smell
*   itching and irritation around the vagina and vulva 
*   soreness and stinging during sex or when you pee
*   redness, but redness can be harder to see on brown and black skin

Treating thrush during pregnancy
--------------------------------

If you're pregnant, you should see a GP or midwife before using treatments for thrush.

Thrush during pregnancy can be treated with cream or a tablet inserted in the vagina (a pessary) that contains [clotrimazole](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/clotrimazole-for-thrush/) or a similar [antifungal medicine](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/antifungal-medicines/).

Normally, thrush can also be treated with antifungal tablets called [fluconazole](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/fluconazole/). But, if you're pregnant, trying to get pregnant or breastfeeding, you should not take anti-thrush tablets.

If you have thrush when your baby is born, the baby may catch it during the delivery. This is nothing to worry about and can easily be treated.

Title: Vaginal bleeding in pregnancy

Published Time: 3 Dec 2020, 8:56 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Bleeding during pregnancy is relatively common and does not always mean there's a problem – but it can be a dangerous sign.

Urgent advice: Call your midwife or GP immediately if:
------------------------------------------------------

*   you have any bleeding from your vagina

Causes of bleeding in early pregnancy
-------------------------------------

### Implantation bleeding

In early pregnancy, you might get some harmless light bleeding, called "spotting". This is when the developing embryo plants itself in the wall of your womb. This type of bleeding often happens around the time your period would have been due.

### Cervical changes

Pregnancy can cause changes to the cervix, and this may sometimes cause bleeding – after sex, for example.

### Miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy

During the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, vaginal bleeding can be a sign of [miscarriage](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/miscarriage/) or [ectopic pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ectopic-pregnancy/).

If you bleed at this stage of pregnancy and the pregnancy ends, there is no reason for you not to go on to have a successful pregnancy.

Treating bleeding in early pregnancy
------------------------------------

You may be offered a medicine called progesterone to stop bleeding in early pregnancy. This will only be recommended if you've had a scan to confirm you're pregnant and you've had a miscarriage before.

Your doctor may recommend you take the medicine twice a day until you're 16 weeks pregnant.

Miscarriage
-----------

If a pregnancy ends before the 24th week, it's called a miscarriage. Around 1 in 5 pregnancies ends this way.

Many early miscarriages (before 13 weeks) happen because there is something wrong with the baby. There can also be other causes of miscarriage, such as hormone or blood clotting problems.

Most miscarriages occur during the first 12 weeks (3 months) of pregnancy and, sadly, most cannot be prevented. Other symptoms of miscarriage include:

*   cramping and pain in your lower abdomen
*   a discharge or fluid from your vagina
*   a discharge of tissue from your vagina
*   no longer experiencing the symptoms of pregnancy, such as feeling sick

If you have bleeding or any of these symptoms, contact your midwife or GP straightaway.

Ectopic pregnancy
-----------------

An [ectopic pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ectopic-pregnancy/) is when a fertilised egg implants outside the womb – for example, in the fallopian tube.

It can cause bleeding and is dangerous because the fertilised egg cannot develop properly outside the womb. The egg has to be removed, which can be done through an operation or with medicines.

Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy tend to develop between 6 to 8 weeks of pregnancy but can happen later.

Other signs of ectopic pregnancy can include:

*   tummy pain low down which may be on one side
*   vaginal bleeding or a brown, watery discharge
*   pain in the tip of your shoulder
*   discomfort when peeing or pooing

Call 111 if you have symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy.

Causes of bleeding in later pregnancy
-------------------------------------

### Cervical changes

These can lead to bleeding, particularly after sex.

### Vaginal infections

Your midwife or doctor can discuss tests and treatment with you.

### A 'show'

This is when the plug of mucus that has been in the cervix during pregnancy comes away, signalling that the cervix is getting ready for labour to start. It may happen a few days before contractions start or during labour itself.

Find out about the [signs of labour](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/signs-that-labour-has-begun/) and [what happens in labour and birth](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/).

### Placental abruption

This is a serious condition in which the placenta starts to come away from the womb wall. Placental abruption usually causes stomach pain, and this may occur even if there is no bleeding.

### Low-lying placenta (placenta praevia)

This is when the placenta is attached in the lower part of the womb, near to or covering the cervix. Bleeding from a low-lying placenta can be very heavy, and put you and your baby at risk.

You may be advised to go into hospital for emergency treatment, and a [caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/) will usually be recommended. [The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists website has more information on placenta praevia](https://www.rcog.org.uk/for-the-public/browse-our-patient-information/placenta-praevia-placenta-accreta-and-vasa-praevia/).

### Vasa praevia

This is a rare condition where the baby's blood vessels run through the membranes covering the cervix.

When your waters break, these vessels may be torn and cause vaginal bleeding. The baby can lose a life-threatening amount of blood.

Finding out the cause of bleeding in pregnancy
----------------------------------------------

To work out what is causing the bleeding, you may need to have a vaginal or pelvic examination, an ultrasound scan or blood tests to check your hormone levels.

Your doctor will also ask you about other symptoms, such as cramp, pain and dizziness. Sometimes it might not be possible to find out what caused the bleeding.

If your symptoms are not severe and your baby is not due for a while, you'll be monitored and, in some cases, kept in hospital for observation.

How long you need to stay in hospital depends on the cause of the bleeding and how many weeks pregnant you are.

Being in hospital allows staff to keep an eye on you and your baby, so they can act quickly if there are further problems.

Vaginal discharge in pregnancy
------------------------------

You will always have some vaginal discharge starting during puberty and reducing after the menopause.

How much discharge you have changes from time to time. It usually gets heavier just before your period. When you're pregnant, it's normal to have more discharge than before.

Healthy vaginal discharge is usually thin, clear or milky white, and should not smell unpleasant.

Non-urgent advice: Call your midwife if you have vaginal discharge and:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*   it smells unpleasant or strange
*   it is green or yellow
*   you feel itchy or sore around your vagina
*   you have pain when you pee

Any of these could be symptoms of a vaginal infection.

Urgent advice: Contact your midwife or doctor immediately if:
-------------------------------------------------------------

Is it normal to have vaginal discharge in pregnancy?
----------------------------------------------------

Yes. It is normal to have more vaginal discharge in pregnancy. This helps prevent any infections travelling up from the vagina to the womb.

Towards the end of pregnancy, the amount of discharge increases further. In the last week or so of pregnancy, it may contain streaks of sticky, jelly-like pink mucus.

This is called a "show", and happens when the mucus that's been present in your cervix during pregnancy comes away.

It's a sign that the body is starting to prepare for birth. You may have a few small "shows" in the days before you go into labour.

Read more about the [signs that labour has begun](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/signs-that-labour-has-begun/).

### Thrush in pregnancy

[Thrush](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/thrush-in-men-and-women/) is an infection that can cause unusual vaginal discharge. If you get thrush when you're pregnant, it can easily be treated – talk to your midwife or doctor.

Thrush can cause:

*   increased vaginal discharge which is usually white (like cottage cheese), and does not usually smell
*   itching and irritation around the vagina

Always talk to your doctor, pharmacist or midwife if you think you have thrush, as there are some thrush medicines you should not use while you're pregnant.

You can help prevent thrush by wearing loose cotton underwear. You may find it helps to avoid perfumed soap or perfumed bath products.

Title: Vomiting and morning sickness

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/vomiting-and-morning-sickness/

Published Time: 3 Dec 2020, 4:17 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, often known as morning sickness, is very common in early pregnancy.

It can affect you at any time of the day or night or you may feel sick all day long.

Morning sickness is unpleasant, and can significantly affect your day-to-day life. But it usually clears up by weeks 16 to 20 of your pregnancy and does not put your baby at any increased risk.

There is a chance of developing a severe form of pregnancy sickness called [hyperemesis gravidarum](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/complications/severe-vomiting/). This can be serious, and there's a chance you may not get enough fluids in your body ([dehydration](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dehydration/)) or not get enough nutrients from your diet ([malnutrition](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/malnutrition/)). You may need specialist treatment, sometimes in hospital.

Sometimes [urinary tract infections (UTIs)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/urinary-tract-infections-utis/) can also cause nausea and vomiting. A UTI usually affects the bladder, but can spread to the kidneys.

Non-urgent advice: Call your midwife, GP or 111 if:
---------------------------------------------------

you're vomiting and:

*   have very dark-coloured urine or have not had a pee in more than 8 hours
*   are unable to keep food or fluids down for 24 hours
*   feel very weak, dizzy or faint when standing up
*   have tummy (abdominal) pain
*   have a high temperature
*   vomit blood
*   have lost weight

Treatments for morning sickness
-------------------------------

Unfortunately, there's no hard and fast treatment that will work for everyone’s morning sickness. Every pregnancy will be different.

But there are some changes you can make to your diet and daily life to try to ease the symptoms.

If these do not work for you or you're having more severe symptoms, your doctor or midwife might recommend medicine.

### Things you can try yourself

If your morning sickness is not too bad, your GP or midwife will initially recommend you try some lifestyle changes:

*   get plenty of rest (tiredness can make nausea worse)
*   avoid foods or smells that make you feel sick
*   eat something like dry toast or a plain biscuit in the morning
*   eat small, frequent meals of plain foods that are high in carbohydrate and low in fat (such as bread, rice, crackers and pasta)
*   eat cold foods rather than hot ones if the smell of hot meals makes you feel sick
*   drink plenty of fluids, such as water (sipping them little and often may help prevent vomiting)
*   eat foods or drinks containing ginger – there's some evidence ginger may help reduce nausea and vomiting (check with your pharmacist before taking ginger supplements during pregnancy)
*   try acupressure – there's some evidence that putting pressure on your wrist, using a special band or bracelet on your forearm or by pressing with your fingers, may help relieve the symptoms

[Find out more about vitamins, supplements and nutrition in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/vitamins-supplements-and-nutrition/)

### Anti-sickness medicine

If your nausea and vomiting is severe and does not improve after trying lifestyle changes, your GP may recommend a short-term course of an anti-sickness medicine, called an antiemetic, that's safe to use in pregnancy.

Often this will be a type of [antihistamine](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/antihistamines/), which are usually used to treat allergies but also work as medicines to stop sickness (antiemetic).

Antiemetics will usually be given as tablets for you to swallow.

But if you have severe morning sickness (hyperemesis gravidarum), your doctor may suggest an injection or a type of medicine that's inserted into your bottom (suppository).

See your GP if you'd like to talk about getting anti-sickness medicine.

Risk factors for morning sickness
---------------------------------

It's thought hormonal changes in the first [12 weeks](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/week-by-week/1-to-12/12-weeks/) of pregnancy are probably one of the causes of morning sickness.

But you may be more at risk of it if:

*   you're having twins or more
*   you had severe sickness and vomiting in a previous pregnancy
*   you tend to get motion sickness (for example, car sick)
*   you have a history of migraine headaches
*   morning sickness runs in the family
*   you used to feel sick when taking contraceptives containing oestrogen
*   it's your first pregnancy
*   you're obese (your BMI is 30 or more)

Title: Weight gain in pregnancy

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/weight-gain/

Published Time: 3 Dec 2020, 1:37 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Weight gain in pregnancy varies greatly. Most pregnant women gain between 10kg and 12.5kg (22lb to 28lb), putting on most of the weight after week 20.

Much of the extra weight is due to your baby growing, but your body will also be storing fat, ready to make breast milk after your baby is born.

Putting on too much or too little weight can lead to health problems for you or your unborn baby.

Gaining too much weight
-----------------------

Putting on too much weight can affect your health and increase your blood pressure.

But pregnancy isn't the time to go on a diet, as it may harm the health of the unborn child.

It's important that you eat healthily.

Gaining too much weight can increase your risk of complications.

These include:

*   [gestational diabetes](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gestational-diabetes/): too much glucose (sugar) in your blood during pregnancy can cause gestational diabetes, which increases your risk of having a large baby
*   [pre-eclampsia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/): a rise in blood pressure can be the first sign of pre-eclampsia; although most cases are mild and cause no trouble, it can be serious

Gaining too little weight
-------------------------

Gaining too little weight can cause problems such as premature birth and a baby with a low birth weight (less than 2.5kg or 5.5lb at birth).

It can also mean your body isn't storing enough fat.

Lack of weight gain can be related to your diet and weight before you become pregnant.

But some naturally slim women stay slim while they're pregnant and have healthy babies.

Staying active
--------------

Staying active is important while you're pregnant, as it'll prepare your body for labour and birth.

Keep up your normal daily activity or exercise, unless you have been advised by your midwife or GP not to exercise.

Advice about your weight
------------------------

Your midwife or GP may have special advice for you if you have a [body mass index (BMI)](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/) of over 30 or below 18.5

If you're concerned about your weight or any other aspect of your health while pregnant, ask your midwife or GP for advice.

**Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a serious condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein in the body, usually in the leg.**

If the clot breaks off into the bloodstream, it can block a blood vessel in the lungs. This is called a [pulmonary embolism](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pulmonary-embolism/) and needs emergency treatment.

Pulmonary embolism can be fatal so it's important that DVT is diagnosed and treated as soon as possible.

[Read more about DVT](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/).

Urgent advice: Call your GP, midwife or 111 immediately if you have:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

*   pain, swelling and tenderness in 1 leg, usually at the back of your lower leg (calf) – the pain may be worse when you walk
*   a heavy ache or warm skin in the affected area
*   red skin, particularly at the back of your leg below the knee

These can be signs of deep vein thrombosis. It usually happens in only 1 leg, but not always.

Immediate action required: Call 999 immediately if you:
-------------------------------------------------------

*   have sudden difficulty breathing
*   have pain or tightness in your chest or upper back
*   are coughing blood

These can be signs of a blood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism).

Information:

During pregnancy it's common to have swelling or discomfort in your legs, so this on its own does not always mean there's a serious problem.

DVT does not always have symptoms.

Are you at risk?
----------------

DVT is not common in pregnancy. But you're more likely to develop DVT at any stage of your pregnancy, and up to 6 weeks after the birth, than people of the same age who are not pregnant.

Your risk of developing DVT during pregnancy is even greater if you:

*   or a close family member have had a blood clot before
*   are over 35
*   are obese (have a body mass index of 30 or more)
*   have had a severe infection or recent serious injury, such as a broken leg
*   have a condition that makes clots more likely [(thrombophilia)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/thrombophilia/)
*   are carrying twins or multiple babies
*   have had 3 or more children
*   have [pre-eclampsia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/) in pregnancy
*   have had fertility treatment
*   are having a caesarean section
*   smoke – [get support to stop smoking](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/stop-smoking/)
*   have severe [varicose veins](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/varicose-veins/) (ones that are painful or above the knee with redness or swelling)
*   are dehydrated
*   have a long labour
*   lose a lot of blood after having your baby

Managing DVT in pregnancy
-------------------------

If you develop a DVT while pregnant, you'll probably need injections of a medicine to stop the blood clot getting bigger so your body can dissolve it.

The medicine, called heparin, does not affect your developing baby.

The injections also reduce your risk of getting a pulmonary embolism and developing another clot.

You'll usually need to have the injections for the rest of your pregnancy and until at least 6 weeks after the birth of your baby.

Although medical treatment for DVT is essential, there are also things you can do to help yourself.

These include:

*   staying active – your midwife or doctor can advise you about [exercise in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/exercise/)
*   wearing prescribed compression stockings to help the circulation in your legs

Travel and DVT
--------------

Travelling for longer than 4 hours (long-haul travel) increases your risk of developing DVT.

It's not known if this risk is greater during pregnancy, but to reduce the risk of DVT while you're travelling:

*   drink plenty of water
*   [avoid drinking alcohol in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/drinking-alcohol-while-pregnant/)
*   perform simple leg exercises, such as regularly flexing your ankles – if you're on a flight, most airlines provide information about exercises you can do to during the flight
*   if possible, walk about during refuelling stops or walk up and down the bus, train or plane (when it's safe to do so)

Title: High blood pressure (hypertension) and pregnancy

Markdown Content:
High blood pressure, or hypertension, does not usually make you feel unwell, but it can sometimes be serious in pregnancy.

Your midwife will check your blood pressure at all your antenatal (pregnancy) appointments.

If you are pregnant and have a history of high blood pressure, you should be referred to a specialist in hypertension and pregnancy to discuss the risks and benefits of treatment.

If you develop high blood pressure for the first time in pregnancy, you will be assessed in a hospital by a healthcare professional, usually a midwife, who is trained in caring for raised blood pressure in pregnancy.

What is high blood pressure
---------------------------

There are 3 levels of hypertension:

*   mild – blood pressure between 140/90 and 149/99mmHg (millimetres of mercury); may be checked regularly but does not usually need treatment
*   moderate – blood pressure between 150/100 and 159/109mmHg
*   severe – blood pressure of 160/110mmHg or higher

If you are already taking medicine for high blood pressure
----------------------------------------------------------

If you're already taking medicine to lower your blood pressure and want to try for a baby, talk to your GP or specialist first. They may want to switch you to a different medicine before you get pregnant.

If you find out you're already pregnant, tell your doctor immediately. They may need to change your medicine as soon as possible.

This is because some medicines that treat high blood pressure may not be safe to take when you're pregnant. They can reduce the blood flow to the placenta and your baby, or affect your baby in other ways.

### Your pregnancy appointments

It's important that your antenatal team monitors you closely throughout your pregnancy to make sure your high blood pressure is not affecting the growth of your baby and to check for a condition called [pre-eclampsia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/). Make sure you go to all your appointments.

Your doctor or midwife will measure your blood pressure and check for protein in your urine. After 20 weeks of pregnancy, you may be offered a PlGF (placental growth factor) test to rule out pre-eclampsia.

During the first half of pregnancy, a woman's blood pressure tends to fall. This means you may be able to come off your medicine for a while. But this should only be done under your doctor's supervision.

Things you can try yourself to reduce high blood pressure
---------------------------------------------------------

Keeping active and doing some physical activity each day, such as walking or swimming, can help keep your blood pressure in the normal range. Eating a balanced diet and keeping your salt intake low can help to reduce blood pressure.

Find out about [exercise in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/exercise/), [healthy eating in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/have-a-healthy-diet/), [salt in the diet](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/salt-in-your-diet/) and [tips for cutting down on salt](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/tips-for-a-lower-salt-diet/).

There isn't enough evidence to show that dietary supplements – such as magnesium, folic acid or fish oils – are effective at preventing high blood pressure.

Pre-eclampsia
-------------

Pre-eclampsia is a condition that affects some pregnant women, typically after 20 weeks.

It is a problem with the placenta that usually causes your blood pressure to rise. If left untreated, pre-eclampsia can be dangerous for you and your baby.

Pre-eclampsia is more common if you had high blood pressure before becoming pregnant, if you had pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy, or if you have a family history of your mother or sister developing pre-eclampsia.

You can feel well if you have high blood pressure, so it is important to attend your regular check-ups to have your blood pressure and urine tested. Read [more about pre-eclampsia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/) and [how pre-eclampsia is treated](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/treatment/).

Labour and birth
----------------

If you're taking medicine throughout pregnancy to control your blood pressure, keep taking it during labour.

If you have mild or moderate hypertension, your blood pressure should be monitored hourly during labour. As long as your blood pressure remains within target levels, you should be able to have a natural vaginal birth.

If you have severe hypertension, your blood pressure will be monitored every 15 to 30 minutes in labour. Your doctors may also recommend your baby be delivered using [forceps or ventouse](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/what-happens/forceps-or-vacuum-delivery/), or by [caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/).

After the birth, your blood pressure will be monitored.

If you had hypertension before you got pregnant, your treatment should be checked 2 weeks after your baby is born.

### Check-ups after the birth

If you developed hypertension while you were pregnant and you're still taking medicine after the birth, you should be offered an appointment with a doctor 2 weeks after you transfer from hospital care to community midwives, or 2 weeks after the birth if you had a home birth.

This is to check whether your treatment needs to be changed or stopped.

Everyone with hypertension in pregnancy should also be offered an appointment with a GP or specialist 6 to 8 weeks after their baby is born.

This appointment is to check your blood pressure, and is separate from your 6-week postnatal check.

Breastfeeding
-------------

You should be able to breastfeed if you need to take hypertension medicine. Your treatment can be changed if needed, in agreement with your doctor.

Hypertension medicines can pass into breast milk. Most lead to very low levels in breast milk, and the amount taken in by babies is very small.

Most medicines are not tested during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Disclaimers or warnings in the manufacturer's information are not because of specific safety concerns or evidence of harm.

Find out about specific [medicines and pregnancy at the website for Bumps (Best use of medicines in pregnancy)](https://www.medicinesinpregnancy.org/Medicine--pregnancy/).

Talk to your midwife or doctor about breastfeeding if you're taking medicine.
