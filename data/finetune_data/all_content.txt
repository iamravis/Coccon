Markdown Content:
A healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle at any time but is especially vital if you're pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Eating healthily during pregnancy will help your baby to develop and grow.

You do not need to go on a special diet, but it's important to eat a variety of different foods every day to get the right balance of nutrients that you and your baby need.

It's best to get vitamins and minerals from the foods you eat, but when you're pregnant you need to take a folic acid supplement as well, to make sure you get everything you need.

Read more about [vitamins and supplements in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/vitamins-supplements-and-nutrition/).

There are also [certain foods that should be avoided in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/foods-to-avoid/).

There's no need to "eat for 2"
------------------------------

You will probably find that you are more hungry than usual, but you do not need to "eat for 2" – even if you are expecting twins or triplets.

Try to have a healthy breakfast every day, because this can help you to avoid snacking on foods that are high in fat and sugar.

Eating healthily often means changing the amounts of different foods you eat, so that your diet is varied, rather than cutting out all your favourites. You can use the [Eatwell Guide](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-guidelines-and-food-labels/the-eatwell-guide/) to get the balance of your diet right. It shows you how much of what you eat should come from each food group to achieve a healthy, balanced diet.

You do not need to achieve this balance with every meal, but try to get the balance right over a week.

Fruit and vegetables in pregnancy
---------------------------------

Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables because these provide vitamins and minerals, as well as fibre, which helps digestion and can help prevent [constipation](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/constipation/).

Eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day – these can include fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced. Always wash fresh fruit and vegetables carefully.

[Find out what counts as a portion of fruit or vegetables](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/5-a-day/portion-sizes/).

Starchy foods (carbohydrates) in pregnancy
------------------------------------------

[Starchy foods](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/starchy-foods-and-carbohydrates/) are an important source of energy, some vitamins and fibre, and help you to feel full without containing too many calories. They include bread, potatoes, breakfast cereals, rice, pasta, noodles, maize, millet, oats, yams and cornmeal. If you are having chips, go for oven chips lower in fat and salt.

These foods should make up just over a 3rd of the food you eat. Instead of refined starchy (white) food, choose wholegrain or higher-fibre options such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or simply leaving the skins on potatoes.

Protein in pregnancy
--------------------

Eat some protein-rich foods every day. Sources of protein include:

*   beans
*   pulses
*   fish
*   eggs
*   meat (but avoid liver)
*   poultry
*   nuts

Choose lean meat, remove the skin from poultry, and try not to add extra fat or oil when cooking meat. Read more about [eating meat in a healthy way](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/meat-nutrition/).

Make sure poultry, burgers, sausages and whole cuts of meat such as lamb, beef and pork are cooked very thoroughly until steaming all the way through. Check that there is no pink meat, and that juices have no pink or red in them.

Try to eat 2 portions of fish each week, 1 of which should be oily fish such as salmon, sardines or mackerel. Find out about [the health benefits of fish and shellfish](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/fish-and-shellfish-nutrition/). There are some types of fish you should avoid when you're pregnant or planning to get pregnant, including shark, swordfish and marlin.

When you're pregnant, you should avoid having more than 2 portions of oily fish a week, such as salmon, trout, mackerel and herring, because it can contain pollutants (toxins).

You should avoid eating some raw or partially cooked eggs, as there is a risk of salmonella.

Eggs produced under the British Lion Code of Practice are safe for pregnant women to eat raw or partially cooked, as they come from flocks that have been vaccinated against salmonella.

These eggs have a red lion logo stamped on their shell. Pregnant women can eat these raw or partially cooked (for example, soft boiled eggs).

Eggs that have not been produced under the Lion Code are considered less safe, and pregnant women are advised to avoid eating them raw or partially cooked, including in mousse, mayonnaise and soufflé. These eggs should be cooked until the white and the yolk are hard.

Find out more about [foods to avoid in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/foods-to-avoid/).

Dairy in pregnancy
------------------

Dairy foods such as milk, cheese, fromage frais and yoghurt are important in pregnancy because they contain calcium and other nutrients that you and your baby need.

Choose low-fat varieties wherever possible, such as semi-skimmed, 1 percent fat or skimmed milk, low-fat and lower-sugar yoghurt and reduced-fat hard cheese.

If you prefer dairy alternatives, such as soya drinks and yoghurts, go for unsweetened, calcium-fortified versions.

Find out more about [dairy and dairy alternatives](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/milk-and-dairy-nutrition/).

There are some cheeses you should avoid in pregnancy, including unpasteurised cheeses. To find out which cheeses you should not eat when you're pregnant on our page about [foods to avoid in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/foods-to-avoid/).

Foods that are high in fat, sugar or both
-----------------------------------------

[Sugary foods and drinks](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/how-does-sugar-in-our-diet-affect-our-health/) are often high in calories, which can contribute to weight gain. Having sugary foods and drinks can also lead to tooth decay.

Fat is very high in calories, so eating too many fatty foods, or eating them too often, can make you put on weight. Eating too much saturated fat can also increase the amount of [cholesterol](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/high-cholesterol/) in your blood, which increases your chance of developing heart disease.

Foods that are high in fat, sugar, or both, include:

*   all spreading fats (such as butter)
*   oils
*   salad dressings
*   cream
*   chocolate
*   crisps
*   biscuits
*   pastries
*   ice cream
*   cake
*   puddings
*   fizzy drinks

If you're having foods and drinks that are high in fat and sugar, have these less often and in small amounts.

Try to [cut down on saturated fat](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/eat-less-saturated-fat/), and have small amounts of foods rich in unsaturated fat instead, such as vegetable oils. Find out about [saturated and unsaturated fat](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/different-fats-nutrition/).

Healthy snacks in pregnancy
---------------------------

If you get hungry between meals, try not to eat snacks that are high in fat and/or sugar, such as sweets, biscuits, crisps or chocolate. Instead, choose something healthier, such as:

*   small sandwiches or pitta bread with grated cheese, lean ham, mashed tuna, salmon, or sardines, with salad
*   salad vegetables, such as carrot, celery or cucumber
*   low-fat, lower-sugar fruit yoghurt, plain yoghurt or fromage frais with fruit
*   ready-to-eat apricots, figs or prunes
*   vegetable and bean soups
*   a small bowl of unsweetened breakfast cereal, or porridge, with milk
*   milky drinks
*   fresh fruit
*   baked beans on toast or a small baked potato
*   a small slice of malt loaf, a fruited tea cake or a slice of toasted fruit bread

When choosing snacks, you can use food labels to help you. Find out [more about food labelling](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-guidelines-and-food-labels/how-to-read-food-labels/), including how the "green, amber, red" code can help you make healthier choices quickly.

Preparing food safely
---------------------

*   Wash fruit, vegetables and salads to remove all traces of soil, which may contain toxoplasma (a parasite that can cause [toxoplasmosis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxoplasmosis/)) which can harm your unborn baby.
*   Wash all surfaces and utensils, and your hands, after preparing raw foods (poultry, meat, eggs, fish, shellfish and raw vegetables) to help you avoid food poisoning.
*   Make sure that raw foods are stored separately from ready-to-eat foods, otherwise there's a risk of contamination.
*   Use a separate knife and chopping board for raw meats.
*   Heat ready meals until they're steaming hot all the way through – this is especially important for meals containing poultry.
*   Check the use-by date to make sure food is safe to eat – do not eat food after the use-by date even if it looks and smells ok.

You also need to make sure that some foods, such as eggs, poultry, burgers, sausages and whole cuts of meat like lamb, beef and pork, are cooked very thoroughly until steaming all the way through.

Title: Vegetarian or vegan and pregnant

**Eating healthily during pregnancy is important for your own health and the health of your developing baby.**

It's important to eat a [varied and balanced diet during pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/have-a-healthy-diet/) to provide enough nutrients for you and the development and growth of your baby.

If you're pregnant and a vegetarian or vegan, you need to make sure you get enough iron and vitamin B12, which are mainly found in meat and fish, and vitamin D, calcium and iodine.

Iron in your diet
-----------------

Good sources of [iron](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/iron/) for vegetarians and vegans include:

*   pulses
*   dark green vegetables
*   wholemeal bread and flour
*   nuts
*   fortified breakfast cereals (with added iron)
*   dried fruit, such as apricots

Vitamin B12 in your diet
------------------------

Good sources of vitamin B12 for vegetarians include milk, cheese and eggs.

Good sources for vegans include:

*   breakfast cereals fortified with vitamin B12
*   unsweetened soya drinks fortified with vitamin B12
*   yeast extract, such as Marmite, and nutritional yeast flakes which are fortified with vitamin B12

Vitamin D in your diet
----------------------

From late March or early April until the end of September, most people should be able to get enough [vitamin D](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/) from sunlight.

Although we get vitamin D from sunlight, vegetarian food sources include:

*   egg yolk
*   foods fortified with vitamin D, including some breakfast cereals and fat spreads
*   dietary supplements

Because vitamin D is found only in a small number of foods, it is difficult to get enough from foods that naturally contain vitamin D and fortified foods alone.

That's why the government recommends that all adults, including those who are pregnant and breastfeeding, should consider taking a daily supplement containing 10 micrograms of vitamin D during the winter months (October until the end of March).

You may be at particular risk of not having enough vitamin D if:

*   you have brown or black skin (for example, if you're of African, African Caribbean or south Asian origin)
*   you cover your skin when outside or spend lots of time indoors

You may need to consider taking a daily supplement of vitamin D all year. Talk to a midwife or doctor for advice.

If you're vegan, check the label to make sure your vitamin D is suitable for vegans.

Calcium in your diet
--------------------

If you're a vegan, you also need to make sure you get enough [calcium](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/calcium/). This is because non-vegans get most of their calcium from dairy foods.

Good sources of calcium for vegans include:

*   dark green leafy vegetables
*   pulses
*   fortified unsweetened soya, pea and oat drinks
*   brown and white bread
*   calcium-set tofu
*   sesame seeds and tahini
*   dried fruit

Talk to your midwife or doctor about how you can get all the nutrients you need for you and your baby.

Iodine in your diet
-------------------

Good sources of [iodine](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/iodine/) for vegetarians include cow's milk, dairy products and eggs.

Iodine can also be found in plant foods, such as cereals and grains, but the levels vary depending on the amount of iodine in the soil where the plants are grown.

If you're vegan then you may want to consider taking an iodine supplement or eating foods fortified with iodine, such as some types of plant-based drinks.

Markdown Content:
**Most foods and drinks are safe to have during pregnancy. But there are some things you should be careful with or avoid.**

Cheese, milk and other dairy

### What you can eat

*   pasteurised milk, yoghurt, cream and ice cream
*   pasteurised or unpasteurised hard cheeses, such as cheddar, gruyere and parmesan
*   pasteurised semi-hard cheeses, such as edam
*   pasteurised soft cheeses, such as cottage cheese, mozzarella, feta, cream cheese, paneer, ricotta, halloumi, goats' cheese without a white coating on the outside (rind) and processed cheese spreads
*   soft or blue cheese (pasteurised or unpasteurised) that has been cooked until steaming hot

### What to avoid

*   any other foods made from unpasteurised milk, such as soft ripened goats' cheese
*   pasteurised or unpasteurised mould-ripened soft cheeses with a white coating on the outside, such as brie, camembert and chèvre (unless cooked until steaming hot)
*   pasteurised or unpasteurised soft blue cheeses, such as danish blue, gorgonzola and roquefort (unless cooked until steaming hot)
*   unpasteurised cows' milk, goats' milk, sheep's milk or cream

### Why

There's a small chance that unpasteurised or soft ripened dairy products may contain Listeria bacteria. This can cause an infection called [listeriosis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/listeriosis/).

Listeriosis can lead to [miscarriage](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/miscarriage/) or [stillbirth](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stillbirth/), or make your newborn baby very unwell.

Soft cheeses with a white coating on the outside have more moisture. This can make it easier for bacteria to grow.

Cooking cheese until it's steaming hot kills bacteria, reducing the risk of listeriosis.

Meat and poultry

### What you can eat

*   meats such as chicken, pork and beef, as long as they're well-cooked with no trace of pink or blood; be especially careful with poultry, pork, sausages and burgers
*   cold, pre-packed meats such as ham and corned beef

### What to be careful with

*   cold cured meats, such as salami, pepperoni, chorizo and prosciutto (unless cooked thoroughly)

### What to avoid

*   raw or undercooked meat
*   liver and liver products
*   all types of pâté, including vegetarian pâté
*   game meats such as goose, partridge or pheasant

### Why

There's a small risk of getting [toxoplasmosis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxoplasmosis/) if you eat raw and undercooked meat, which can cause [miscarriage](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/miscarriage/).

Cured meats are not cooked, so they may have parasites in them that cause toxoplasmosis.

Liver and liver products have lots of vitamin A in them. This can be harmful to an unborn baby.

Game meats may contain lead shot.

Eggs

### What you can eat

*   raw, partially cooked and fully cooked British Lion hen eggs (they have a lion stamp on them) and hen eggs produced under the Laid in Britain scheme
*   foods made with raw hen egg, such as mousse and mayonnaise, if made with British Lion eggs or hen eggs produced under the Laid in Britain scheme
*   well cooked eggs (white and yolk) from any hen eggs that are not British Lion eggs or produced under the Laid in Britain scheme
*   well cooked eggs (white and yolk) of all other eggs, including duck, goose or quail

### What to avoid

*   raw or partially cooked hen eggs that are not British Lion or produced under the Laid in Britain scheme
*   raw or partially cooked duck, goose or quail eggs

### Why

British Lion hen eggs and hen eggs produced under the Laid in Britain scheme are less likely to have salmonella in them.

Salmonella is unlikely to harm your unborn baby, but you could get [food poisoning](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/food-poisoning/).

You should cook all eggs thoroughly, unless they are British Lion hen eggs or hen eggs produced under the Laid in Britain scheme.

Fish

### What you can eat

*   cooked fish and seafood
*   sushi, as long as the fish has been cooked thoroughly
*   cooked shellfish, such as mussels, lobster, crab, prawns, scallops and clams

### What to limit

*   you should eat no more than 2 portions of oily fish a week, such as salmon, trout, mackerel or herring
*   you should eat no more than 2 tuna steaks (about 140g cooked or 170g raw) or 4 medium-size cans of tuna (about 140g when drained) per week

Information:

#### Tuna does not count as an oily fish

You can have 2 tuna steaks, or 4 medium-size cans of fish, as well as 2 portions of oily fish a week.

### What to avoid

*   swordfish
*   marlin
*   shark
*   raw shellfish
*   cold-smoked or cured fish (for example smoked salmon or gravlax, including in sushi), unless it has been cooked until steaming hot

### Why

You should avoid ready-to-eat cold-smoked or cured fish because it could be contaminated with listeria bacteria. These bacteria can cause an infection called listeriosis, which can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth, or make your newborn baby seriously ill. Cooking smoked or cured fish until it's steaming hot will kill any bacteria that may be present.

You should limit tuna because it has more mercury in it than other fish. If you eat too much mercury, it can be harmful to your unborn baby.

You should limit oily fish because they can have pollutants such as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls in them. If you eat too much of these, they can be harmful to your unborn baby.

You should avoid raw shellfish because they can have harmful bacteria, viruses or toxins in them. These can make you unwell and give you food poisoning.

Other foods and drinks

### Caffeine

You can have caffeine, but no more than 200mg per day. Regularly drinking more than this amount can increase your risk of pregnancy complications, such as low birthweight, and even miscarriage.

There is:

*   100mg in a mug of instant coffee
*   140mg in a mug of filter coffee
*   75mg in a mug of tea (green tea can have the same amount of caffeine as regular tea)
*   40mg in a can of cola
*   80mg in a 250ml can of energy drink
*   less than 25mg in a 50g bar of plain dark chocolate
*   less than 10mg in a 50g bar of plain milk chocolate

### Herbal teas

The caffeine content can vary quite widely between different brands of herbal tea. Some contain no caffeine, while others may have quite high levels.

Check the ingredients label on the packet to see how much caffeine is in a brand. Some of the herbs used in herbal tea can also be potentially dangerous if you have a lot of them during pregnancy; especially during weeks 1 to 12 (first trimester).

As a general rule, if you drink no more than 1 to 2 cups of herbal tea a day during your pregnancy, you should be fine.

### Alcohol

Drinking [alcohol in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/drinking-alcohol-while-pregnant/) can lead to long-term harm to your baby.

If you're pregnant or planning to get pregnant, the safest approach is to not drink alcohol at all.

This keeps risks to your baby to a minimum.

### Liquorice

Liquorice is safe to eat. But you should avoid liquorice root.

### Fruits, vegetables and salads

Be careful with fruits, vegetables and salads as they can have soil on them, which can make you unwell.

Make sure to thoroughly wash all fruits, vegetables and salad ingredients.

### Peanuts

You do not need to avoid eating peanuts when you're pregnant.

Only avoid eating peanuts if you're advised to by a healthcare professional, or if you have a nut allergy.

### Vitamins

Do not take high-dose multivitamin supplements, or any supplements with vitamin A in them.

Title: Vitamins, minerals and supplements in pregnancy

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/vitamins-supplements-and-nutrition/

Published Time: 2 Dec 2020, 1:49 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Eating a healthy, varied [diet in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/have-a-healthy-diet/) will help you get most of the vitamins and minerals you need.

But when you're pregnant, or there's a chance you might get pregnant, it's important to also take a folic acid supplement.

It's recommended that you take:

*   400 micrograms of folic acid every day – from before you're pregnant until you're 12 weeks pregnant

This is to reduce the risk of problems in the baby's development in the early weeks of pregnancy.

It is also recommended that you take a daily [vitamin D](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/) supplement.

Do not take cod liver oil or any supplements containing vitamin A (retinol) when you're pregnant. Too much vitamin A could harm your baby. Always check the label.

[You also need to know which foods to avoid in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/foods-to-avoid/)

Where to get pregnancy supplements
----------------------------------

You can get supplements from pharmacies and supermarkets, or a GP may be able to prescribe them for you.

If you want to get your folic acid from a multivitamin tablet, make sure the tablet does not contain vitamin A (or retinol).

You may be able to get free vitamins if you qualify for the Healthy Start scheme.

[Find out more about the Healthy Start scheme](https://www.healthystart.nhs.uk/)

Folic acid before and during pregnancy
--------------------------------------

It's important to take a 400 micrograms folic acid tablet every day before you're pregnant and until you're 12 weeks pregnant.

Folic acid can help prevent birth defects known as neural tube defects, including [spina bifida](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/spina-bifida/).

If you did not take folic acid before you conceived, you should start as soon as you find out you're pregnant.

Try to eat green leafy vegetables which contain folate (the natural form of folic acid) and breakfast cereals and fat spreads with folic acid added to them.

It's difficult to get the amount of folate recommended for a healthy pregnancy from food alone, which is why it's important to take a folic acid supplement.

Higher-dose folic acid
----------------------

If you have a higher chance of your pregnancy being affected by neural tube defects, you will be advised to take a higher dose of folic acid (5 milligrams). You will be advised to take this each day until you're 12 weeks pregnant.

You may have a higher chance if:

*   you or the baby's biological father have a neural tube defect
*   you or the baby's biological father have a family history of neural tube defects
*   you have had a previous pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect
*   you have [diabetes](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetes/)
*   you take anti-epilepsy medicine
*   you take anti-retroviral medicine for HIV

If any of this applies to you, talk to a GP. They can prescribe a higher dose of folic acid.

A GP or midwife may also recommend additional screening tests during your pregnancy.

[Find out about epilepsy and pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/existing-health-conditions/epilepsy/)

Vitamin D in pregnancy
----------------------

You need 10 micrograms of vitamin D each day. It's recommended pregnant and breastfeeding women take a daily supplement containing this amount between September and March.

Vitamin D regulates the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body, which are needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy. Our bodies make vitamin D when our skin is exposed to summer sunlight (from late March/early April to the end of September)

Between the months of September and March the body cannot make sufficient vitamin D from sunlight alone, which is why a supplement is recommended.

Vitamin D is also in some foods, including:

*   oily fish (such as salmon, mackerel, herring and sardines)
*   eggs
*   red meat

Vitamin D is also added to some breakfast cereals, fat spreads and non-dairy milk alternatives. The amounts added to these products can vary and might only be small.

Because vitamin D is only found in a small number of foods, whether naturally occurring or added, it is difficult to get enough from foods alone.

Do not take more than 100 micrograms (4,000 IU) of vitamin D a day as it could be harmful.

You can get vitamin supplements containing vitamin D free of charge if you're pregnant or breastfeeding and qualify for the [Healthy Start scheme](https://www.healthystart.nhs.uk/).

Information:

There have been some reports about vitamin D reducing the risk of coronavirus (COVID-19). But there is currently not enough evidence to support taking vitamin D solely to prevent or treat COVID-19.

### If you have dark skin or cover your skin a lot

You may be at particular risk of not having enough vitamin D if:

*   you have dark skin (for example, if you're of African, African Caribbean or south Asian origin)
*   you cover your skin when outside or spend lots of time indoors

You may need to consider taking a daily supplement of vitamin D all year. Talk to a midwife or doctor for advice.

Iron in pregnancy
-----------------

If you do not have enough iron, you'll probably get very tired and may suffer from [anaemia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/iron-deficiency-anaemia/).

Lean meat, green leafy vegetables, dried fruit and nuts contain iron.

If you'd like to eat peanuts or foods that contain peanuts (such as peanut butter) during pregnancy, you can do so as part of a healthy, balanced diet unless you're allergic to them or your health professional advises you not to.

Many breakfast cereals have iron added to them. If the iron level in your blood becomes low, a GP or midwife will advise you to take iron supplements.

Vitamin C in pregnancy
----------------------

Vitamin C protects cells and helps keep them healthy.

It's found in a wide variety of fruit and vegetables, and a balanced diet can provide all the vitamin C you need.

Good sources include:

*   oranges and orange juice
*   red and green peppers
*   strawberries
*   blackcurrants
*   broccoli
*   brussels sprouts
*   potatoes

Calcium in pregnancy
--------------------

Calcium is vital for making your baby's bones and teeth.

Sources of calcium include:

*   milk, cheese and yoghurt
*   green leafy vegetables, such as rocket, watercress or curly kale
*   tofu
*   soya drinks with added calcium
*   bread and any foods made with fortified flour
*   fish where you eat the bones, such as sardines and pilchards

Vegetarian, vegan and special diets in pregnancy
------------------------------------------------

A varied and balanced vegetarian diet should provide enough nutrients for you and your baby during pregnancy.

But you might find it more difficult to get enough iron and vitamin B12.

Talk to a midwife or doctor about how to make sure you're getting enough of these important nutrients.

If you're vegan or you follow a restricted diet because of a food intolerance (for example, a gluten-free diet for coeliac disease) or for religious reasons, talk to a midwife or GP.

Ask to be referred to a dietitian for advice on how to make sure you're getting all the nutrients you need for you and your baby.

[Find out more about healthy eating if you're pregnant and vegetarian or vegan](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/vegetarian-or-vegan-and-pregnant/)

Healthy Start vitamins
----------------------

The Healthy Start scheme may be able to help you buy food and milk if you're pregnant or have a child under 4 years old and receive certain benefits, or you’re pregnant and under 18.

If you're eligible, you'll be sent a Healthy Start card which you can use to buy certain types of milk, infant formula, fruit and vegetables.

You can also use your card to get free vitamins.

If you're not eligible for the Healthy Start scheme, some NHS organisations still offer the vitamins for free, or sell them. Ask a midwife about what's available in your area.

The more active and fit you are during pregnancy, the easier it will be for you to adapt to your changing shape and weight gain. It will also help you to cope with [labour](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/signs-that-labour-has-begun/).

Keep up your normal daily physical activity or exercise (sport, running, yoga, dancing, or even walking to the shops and back) for as long as you feel comfortable.

Exercise is not dangerous for your baby. There is evidence that active women are less likely to experience problems in later pregnancy and labour.

Exercise tips for pregnancy
---------------------------

Do not exhaust yourself. You may need to slow down as your pregnancy progresses or if your maternity team advises you to. If in doubt, consult your maternity team.

As a general rule, you should be able to hold a conversation as you exercise when pregnant. If you become breathless as you talk, then you're probably exercising too strenuously.

If you were not active before you got pregnant, do not suddenly take up strenuous exercise. If you start an aerobic exercise programme (such as running, swimming, cycling or aerobics classes), tell the instructor that you're pregnant.

Remember that exercise does not have to be strenuous to be beneficial.

Exercise tips when you're pregnant:

*   always warm up before exercising, and cool down afterwards
*   try to keep active on a daily basis – 30 minutes of walking each day can be enough, but if you cannot manage that, any amount is better than nothing
*   avoid any strenuous exercise in hot weather
*   drink plenty of water and other fluids
*   if you go to exercise classes, make sure your teacher is properly qualified and knows that you're pregnant, as well as how many weeks pregnant you are
*   you might like to try swimming because the water will support your increased weight. Some local swimming pools provide aqua-natal classes with qualified instructors. [Find your local swimming pool](https://www.swimming.org/poolfinder/)
*   exercises that have a risk of falling, such as horse riding, downhill skiing, ice hockey, gymnastics and cycling, should only be done with caution. Falls carry a risk of damage to your baby

Exercises to avoid in pregnancy
-------------------------------

*   do not lie flat on your back for long periods, particularly after 16 weeks, because the weight of your bump presses on the main blood vessel bringing blood back to your heart and this can make you feel faint
*   do not take part in contact sports where there's a risk of being hit, such as kickboxing, judo or squash
*   do not go scuba diving, because the baby has no protection against decompression sickness and gas embolism (gas bubbles in the bloodstream)
*   do not exercise at heights over 2,500m above sea level – this is because you and your baby are at risk of [altitude sickness](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/altitude-sickness/)

Exercises for a fitter pregnancy
--------------------------------

If you are pregnant, try to fit the exercises listed in this section into your daily routine. These types of exercise will strengthen your muscles to help you carry the extra weight of pregnancy. They'll also make your joints stronger, improve circulation, ease backache, and generally help you feel well.

### Stomach-strengthening exercises

As your baby gets bigger, you may find that the hollow in your lower back increases and this can give you backache. These exercises strengthen stomach (abdominal) muscles and may ease backache, which can be a problem in pregnancy:

*   start in a box position (on all 4s) with knees under hips, hands under shoulders, with fingers facing forward and abdominals lifted to keep your back straight
*   pull in your stomach muscles and raise your back up towards the ceiling, curling your trunk and allowing your head to relax gently forward. Do not let your elbows lock
*   hold for a few seconds then slowly return to the box position
*   take care not to hollow your back: it should always return to a straight/neutral position
*   do this slowly and rhythmically 10 times, making your muscles work hard and moving your back carefully
*   only move your back as far as you can comfortably

### Pelvic tilt exercises

*   stand with your shoulders and bottom against a wall
*   keep your knees soft
*   pull your tummy button towards your spine, so that your back flattens against the wall: hold for 4 seconds then release
*   repeat up to 10 times

### Pelvic floor exercises

[Pelvic floor exercises](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/lifestyle/what-are-pelvic-floor-exercises/) help to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor, which come under great strain in pregnancy and childbirth. The pelvic floor consists of layers of muscles that stretch like a supportive hammock from the pubic bone (in front) to the end of the backbone (spine).

If your pelvic floor muscles are weak, you may find that you leak urine when you cough, sneeze or strain. This is quite common, and there is no reason to feel embarrassed. It's known as [stress incontinence](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/urinary-incontinence/symptoms#common-types-of-urinary-incontinence) and it can continue after pregnancy.

You can strengthen these muscles by doing pelvic floor exercises. This helps to reduce or avoid stress incontinence after pregnancy. All pregnant women should do pelvic floor exercises, even if you're young and not suffering from stress incontinence now.

How to do pelvic floor exercises:

*   make yourself comfortable by sitting or lying down with your knees bent
*   squeeze in and tighten the muscles around your back passage as if you were trying to stop yourself peeing and farting
*   breathe in as you squeeze in and tighten the muscles, and then breathe out while relaxing the muscles
*   at first, try to do this exercise quickly
*   then do it slowly, holding the squeezes for as long as you can before you relax: try to count to 10
*   try to do 3 sets of 8 squeezes every day: to help you remember, you could do a set at each meal

As well as these exercises, practice tightening the pelvic floor muscles before and during coughing and sneezing.

Title: Medicines in pregnancy

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/medicines/

Published Time: 2 Dec 2020, 2:12 p.m.

Markdown Content:
**Most medicines taken during pregnancy cross the placenta and reach the baby.**

Before taking any medicine when you're pregnant, including painkillers, check with your pharmacist, midwife or GP that it's suitable.

When deciding whether to take a medicine during pregnancy, it's important to find out about the possible effects of that medicine on your baby.

This is the case both for medicines prescribed by a doctor and for medicines you buy from a pharmacy or shop.

Which medicines are safe?
-------------------------

You can find out information on medicines in pregnancy on the [bumps (best use of medicines in pregnancy)](http://www.medicinesinpregnancy.org/Medicine--pregnancy/) website.

They also have advice on what to do if you have already taken a medicine in pregnancy.

But it's also important to never stop taking a medicine that's been prescribed to keep you healthy without first checking with your doctor.

Stopping taking your medicine could be harmful to both you and your baby.

If you're trying for a baby or are already pregnant, it's important to always:

*   talk to your doctor immediately if you take regular medicine, ideally before you start trying for a baby or as soon as you find out you're pregnant
*   check with your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before taking any prescribed medicines or medicines that you have bought
*   make sure your doctor, dentist or another healthcare professional knows you're pregnant before they prescribe anything or give you treatment

If you cannot find information about a specific medicine on [bumps](http://www.medicinesinpregnancy.org/), you can ask your doctor, midwife or pharmacist to contact the [UK Teratology Information Service (UKTIS)](http://www.uktis.org/) for advice on your behalf.

Herbal and homeopathic remedies and aromatherapy in pregnancy
-------------------------------------------------------------

Not all "natural" remedies or complementary therapies are safe in pregnancy.

Some products used may not be of a high quality and may contain other substances, such as lead, that could be harmful.

You're also advised not to take herbal remedies if you're trying to get pregnant.

Tell your midwife, doctor or pharmacist if you're using herbal, homeopathic or aromatherapy remedies or therapies.

If you do decide to use these therapies, you should always consult a qualified practitioner.

You should tell your practitioner that you're pregnant before discussing any treatment.

The [Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (PSA)](http://www.professionalstandards.org.uk/find-registers) provides information on qualified or registered practitioners.

Organisations with PSA-accredited voluntary registers include:

*   the [Complementary & Natural Healthcare Council](http://www.cnhc.org.uk/)
*   the [Federation of Holistic Therapists](http://www.fht.org.uk/)

Complementary remedies or therapies cannot replace conventional antenatal care.

It's important to go to all your regular [antenatal check-ups](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/antenatal-checks-and-tests/) throughout your pregnancy.

Title: Mental health problems and pregnancy

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/mental-health/

Published Time: 2 Dec 2020, 2:42 p.m.

Markdown Content:
**Being pregnant is a big life event and it is natural to feel a lot of different emotions. But if you’re feeling sad and it’s starting to affect your life, there are things you can try that may help.**

Things you can try to help with your mental health
--------------------------------------------------

### Do

*   talk about your feelings to a friend, family member, doctor or midwife
    
*   try [calming breathing exercises](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/guides-tools-and-activities/breathing-exercises-for-stress/) if you feel overwhelmed
    
*   do physical activity if you can – it can improve your mood and help you sleep
    
*   eat a healthy diet with regular meals
    
*   try to attend [antenatal classes](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/antenatal-classes/) to meet others who are expecting babies around the same time as you
    

### Don’t

*   do not compare yourself to others – everyone experiences pregnancy in different ways
    
*   do not be afraid to tell healthcare professionals how you are feeling – they are there to listen and support you
    
*   do not use alcohol, cigarettes or drugs to try and feel better – these can make you feel worse and affect your baby's growth and wellbeing
    

### Non-urgent advice: Speak to your midwife or a doctor if:

*   things you're trying yourself are not helping

They can offer you support. They may offer you a referral to perinatal mental health services or other emotional support. Perinatal means the time you are pregnant and up to 12 months after giving birth.

NHS therapy and counselling services
------------------------------------

If you're feeling sad and it's not improving, a talking therapy might help.

There are different types of talking therapies for mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).

Talking therapies include [cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/overview/) and [counselling](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/counselling/).

A GP can refer you for talking treatment, or you can refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without going to a GP. If you refer yourself, it's a good idea to talk to a midwife or GP as well about how you're feeling.

[Find an NHS talking therapies service](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/mental-health/find-an-NHS-talking-therapies-service/)

Medicine for mental health problems
-----------------------------------

You may be offered medicine to treat your symptoms.

If you decide to take medicine while you're pregnant or breastfeeding speak to your doctor. They will help you weigh up the risks and benefits, so you can decide on the best treatment for you and your baby.

They'll offer you the safest medicine at the lowest amount that will still work.

**Mental health problems**
--------------------------

There are many mental health problems you could experience in pregnancy. They can happen at any time, even if this is not your first pregnancy.

You may also find it hard to cope with your body changing shape, particularly if you have had an [eating disorder](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/feelings-symptoms-behaviours/behaviours/eating-disorders/overview/).

Further support

You can [find care for your mental health before, during and after pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/mental-health-services/find-care-for-your-mental-health-before-during-and-after-pregnancy/).

==================================================

Content from https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/depression/:

Title: Depression in pregnancy

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/depression/

Published Time: 9 Nov 2021, 3:35 p.m.

Markdown Content:
**You can get depression when you are pregnant. This is called antenatal depression.**

With help and support most people with antenatal depression are able to manage the condition.

If antenatal depression is not treated symptoms can get worse and may continue after the baby is born ([postnatal depression](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/post-natal-depression/overview/)). So it is important to get help if you need it.

Symptoms
--------

Some mood changes are normal in pregnancy, like feeling tired or irritable. But if you’re feeling low and hopeless all the time, and no longer enjoy the things you used to, talk to a midwife or GP.

Signs and symptoms of antenatal depression include:

*   feeling sad, a low mood, or tearful a lot of the time
*   feeling irritable, or getting angry easily
*   losing interest in other people and the world around you
*   not wanting to eat or eating more than usual
*   negative thoughts, such as worrying you will not be able to look after your baby
*   feeling guilty, hopeless or blaming yourself for your problems
*   having problems concentrating or making decisions

Urgent advice: Contact a GP immediately if:
-------------------------------------------

You, or a friend or relative who is pregnant:

*   starts hearing or seeing things that are not real (hallucinations)
*   develop strong beliefs not shared by others (delusions)

If it is not possible to contact a GP, call [NHS 111](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/urgent-and-emergency-care-services/when-to-use-111/) or your local [out-of-hours service](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/urgent-and-emergency-care-services/nhs-out-of-hours-services/).

Immediate action required: Call 999 if:
---------------------------------------

*   you think there is a danger that you might harm yourself or others
*   you are worried that someone else might harm themselves or others

Treatment
---------

Speak to a GP or your midwife as soon as possible if you think you might have antenatal depression.

With appropriate treatment and support, most people are able to manage their symptoms, though it can take time.

### Self-help

A GP or midwife may recommend a number of self-help tips that can help improve your mood. These include:

*   talking about your feelings to a friend, family member, doctor or midwife
*   trying [calming breathing exercises](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/ways-relieve-stress/) if you feel overwhelmed
*   increasing [physical activity](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/exercise/) levels if you can as it can improve your mood and help you sleep
*   attending [antenatal classes](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/preparing-for-the-birth/antenatal-classes/) to meet others who are expecting babies around the same time as you
*   eating a [healthy diet](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/)

### Psychological therapy

A GP may recommend a self-help course or refer you for therapy, such as [cognitive behavioural therapy](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/overview/) (CBT) or counselling.

It may take several weeks to see a therapist or counsellor. CBT can be done ‘face to face’ with a counsellor or online, using a computer.

A GP should be able to explain more about different ways you can have CBT.

### Antidepressants

Antidepressant medicines may be recommended for you if you have moderate or severe depression and:

*   you do not want to use psychological therapy
*   psychological therapy has not worked for you
*   you prefer to take medicine

Some people may benefit from having both psychological therapy and taking antidepressants.

Talk to a GP (or doctor in charge of your care) about antidepressants that are safer to take during pregnancy.

The doctor will usually offer the type with the lowest risk for you and your baby.

Your doctor can explain the risks and the benefits, and will help you decide which treatment is best for you and your baby.

Other mental health conditions that can develop during pregnancy, or get worse because you are pregnant, include:

*   [anxiety disorders](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder/overview/), including generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder
*   [obsessive compulsive disorder](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/overview/) (OCD), where intrusive, unwanted and unpleasant thoughts, images or urges repeatedly enter a person's mind, causing them anxiety and leading to repetitive behaviours

Title: Sex in pregnancy

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/sex/

Published Time: 2 Dec 2020, 2:49 p.m.

Markdown Content:
It's perfectly safe to have sex during pregnancy unless your doctor or midwife has told you not to.

Having sex will not hurt your baby. A penis or penetrative sex toy cannot penetrate beyond your vagina, and the baby cannot tell what's going on.

However, it's normal for your sex drive to change during pregnancy. This isn't something to worry about, but it's helpful to talk about it with your sexual partner.

You may find having sex very enjoyable during pregnancy, or simply feel you don't want to. You can find other ways of being loving or making love. The most important thing is to talk about your feelings with your partner.

If your pregnancy is normal and you have no complications, having sex and orgasms won't increase your risk of going into labour early or cause a miscarriage.

Later in pregnancy, an orgasm or even sex itself can set off mild contractions. If this happens, you'll feel the muscles of your womb go hard. These are known as Braxton Hicks contractions and can be uncomfortable, but they're perfectly normal and there's no need for alarm. You might want to try some relaxation techniques or just lie down until the contractions pass.

When to avoid sex in pregnancy
------------------------------

Your midwife or doctor will probably advise you to avoid sex if you've had any heavy bleeding in this pregnancy. Sex may increase the risk of further bleeding if the placenta is low or there's a collection of blood (haematoma).

You may also be advised to avoid sex if:

*   your waters have broken – it can increase the risk of infection (ask your midwife or doctor if you're not sure whether your waters have broken)
*   there are any problems with the entrance to your womb (cervix) – you may be at a higher risk of going into early labour or having a miscarriage
*   you have previously had early labours, or you're having more than 1 baby and are in the later stages of pregnancy

If you or your sexual partner are having sex with other people during your pregnancy, it's important you use a barrier form of contraception, such as a [condom](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/male-condoms/), to protect you and your baby from [sexually transmitted infections (STIs)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis/).

Do not have sex with someone who has an STI, or you think may have an STI.

Good and bad sex positions during pregnancy
-------------------------------------------

While sex is safe for most couples in pregnancy, it may not be all that easy. You will probably need to find different positions. This can be a time to explore and experiment together.

Sex with your partner on top can become uncomfortable quite early in pregnancy, not just because of the bump, but because your breasts might be tender. It can also be uncomfortable if your partner penetrates you too deeply.

It may be better to lie on your sides, either facing each other or with your partner behind. You may also want to try being on top during sex or being penetrated from behind while on your hands and knees. Use pillows to make yourself comfortable.

Title: Travelling in pregnancy

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/travelling/

Published Time: 2 Dec 2020, 3:22 p.m.

Markdown Content:
With the proper precautions such as travel insurance, most women can travel safely well into their pregnancy.

Wherever you go, find out what healthcare facilities are at your destination in case you need urgent medical attention. It's a good idea to take your maternity medical records (sometimes called handheld notes) with you so you can give doctors the relevant information if necessary.

Find out more about [getting healthcare abroad](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/).

Make sure your travel insurance covers you for any eventuality, such as pregnancy-related medical care during labour, premature birth and the cost of changing the date of your return trip if you go into [labour](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/signs-that-labour-has-begun/).

When to travel in pregnancy
---------------------------

Some women prefer not to travel in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy because of [nausea and vomiting](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/vomiting-and-morning-sickness/) and feeling very tired during these early stages. The risk of [miscarriage](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/miscarriage/) is also higher in the first 3 months, whether you're travelling or not.

Travelling in the final months of pregnancy can be tiring and uncomfortable. So, many women find the best time to travel or take a holiday is in mid-pregnancy, between 4 and 6 months.

Flying in pregnancy
-------------------

Flying isn't harmful to you or your baby, but discuss any health issues or pregnancy complications with your midwife or doctor before you fly.

The chance of going into labour is naturally higher after [37 weeks](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/week-by-week/28-to-40-plus/37-weeks/) (around 32 weeks if you're carrying twins), and some airlines won't let you fly towards the end of your pregnancy. Check with the airline for their policy on this.

After week 28 of pregnancy, the airline may ask for a letter from your doctor or midwife confirming your due date, and that you are not at risk of complications. You may have to pay for the letter and wait several weeks before you get it.

Long-distance travel (longer than 4 hours) carries a small risk of blood clots [(deep vein thrombosis (DVT))](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt/). If you fly, drink plenty of water and move about regularly – every 30 minutes or so. You can buy a pair of graduated compression or support stockings from the pharmacy, which will help reduce leg swelling.

Travel vaccinations when you're pregnant
----------------------------------------

Most vaccines that use live bacteria or viruses aren't recommended during pregnancy because of concerns that they could harm the baby in the womb.

However, some live travel vaccines may be considered during pregnancy if the risk of infection outweighs the risk of live vaccination. Ask your GP or midwife for advice about specific travel vaccinations. Non-live (inactivated) vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy.

Malaria tablets
---------------

Some anti-malaria tablets aren't safe to take in pregnancy so ask your GP for advice.

Zika virus
----------

[Zika virus](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/zika/) is mainly spread by mosquitoes found in some parts of the world. For most people it's mild and not harmful, but can cause problems if you're pregnant.

If you are pregnant, it is not recommended to travel to parts of the world where the Zika virus is present, such as parts of:

*   South and Central America
*   the Caribbean
*   the Pacific islands
*   Africa
*   Asia

### Check before you travel

It's important to check the risk for the country you're going to before you travel.

[Find out more about the Zika virus risk in specific countries on the Travel Health Pro website](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/countries)

Car travel in pregnancy
-----------------------

It's best to avoid long car journeys if you're pregnant. However, if it can't be avoided, make sure you stop regularly and get out of the car to stretch and move around.

You can also do some exercises in the car (when you're not driving), such as flexing and rotating your feet and wiggling your toes. This will keep the blood flowing through your legs and reduce any stiffness and discomfort. Wearing compression stockings while on long car journeys (more than 4 hours) can also increase the blood flow in your legs and help prevent blood clots.

Tiredness and dizziness are common during pregnancy so it's important on car journeys to drink regularly and eat natural, energy-giving foods, such as fruit and nuts.

Keep the air circulating in the car and wear your seatbelt with the cross strap between your breasts and the lap strap across your pelvis under your bump, not across your bump.

Road accidents are among the most common causes of injury in pregnant women. If you have to make a long trip, don't travel on your own. You could also share the driving with your companion.

Sailing in pregnancy
--------------------

Ferry companies have their own restrictions and may refuse to carry heavily pregnant women (often beyond 32 weeks on standard crossings and 28 weeks on high-speed crossings ). Check the ferry company's policy before you book.

For longer boat trips, such as cruises, find out if there are onboard facilities to deal with pregnancy and medical services at the docking ports.

Food and drink abroad in pregnancy
----------------------------------

Take care to avoid food- and water-borne conditions, such as stomach upsets and travellers' [diarrhoea](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diarrhoea-and-vomiting/). Some medicines for treating stomach upsets and travellers' diarrhoea aren't suitable during pregnancy.

Always check if tap water is safe to drink. If in doubt, drink bottled water. If you get ill, keep hydrated and continue eating for the health of your baby, even if you're not hungry.

Your rights at work while you're pregnant
-----------------------------------------

If you're working while you're pregnant, you need to know your rights to antenatal care, [maternity leave and benefits](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/finding-out/maternity-and-paternity-benefits-and-leave/).

If you have any worries about your health while at work, talk to your doctor, midwife or occupational health nurse. You can also talk to your employer, union representative, or someone in the personnel department (HR) where you work.

Once you tell your employer that you're pregnant, they should do a risk assessment with you to see if your job poses any risks to you or your baby. If there are any risks, they have to make reasonable adjustments to remove them. This can include changing your working hours.

If you work with chemicals, lead or X-rays, or in a job with a lot of lifting, it may be illegal for you to continue to work. Your employer must offer you alternative work on the same terms and conditions as your original job.

If there's no safe alternative, your employer should suspend you on full pay (give you paid leave) for as long as necessary to avoid the risk. In this case, your employer can start your maternity leave 4 weeks before your due date.

If your employer fails to pay you during your suspension, you can bring a claim in an employment tribunal (within 3 months). This wouldn't affect your maternity pay or maternity leave.

[Find out more about maternity pay and leave on the GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave)

You may worry about using computer screens in pregnancy. But the most recent research shows no evidence of a risk to your baby or pregnancy from visual display units (VDUs) on computers.

[GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/working-when-pregnant-your-rights), [Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/work/maternity-and-parental-rights/check-your-maternity-and-parental-rights/rights-while-pregnant-or-on-maternity-leave/rights-while-youre-pregnant-at-work/) and [Maternity Action](https://www.maternityaction.org.uk/work-and-benefits/) have more information on pregnant employees' rights, including your right to paid time off for antenatal care and what to do if you feel you're being treated unfairly.

Coping with pregnancy symptoms at work
--------------------------------------

You might get more tired than usual, particularly in the first and last few [weeks of pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/week-by-week/).

Try to use your lunch break to eat and rest. Your employer may also need to give you extra breaks. If travelling in rush hour is exhausting, ask your employer if you can work slightly different hours for a while.

Don't rush home and start another job cleaning and cooking. If possible, ask your friend, partner or a member of your family to help you.

Read more about [tiredness in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/tiredness/).

If you're struggling with nausea and vomiting (morning sickness), you might be finding it hard at work.

You can ask your employer about working slightly different hours to avoid times when you feel worse, or working from home on days when the morning sickness is bad.

Speak to a GP or midwife if you feel particularly bad or unwell.

Markdown Content:
When you'll feel your baby move
-------------------------------

You should start to feel your baby move between 16 to 24 weeks of pregnancy. If this is your first baby, you might not feel movements until after 20 weeks.

If you have not felt your baby move by 24 weeks, tell your midwife. They'll check your baby's heartbeat and movements.

You should feel your baby move right up to and during labour.

What your baby's movements feel like
------------------------------------

The movements can feel like a gentle swirling or fluttering. As your pregnancy progresses, you may feel kicks and jerky movements.

Urgent advice: Call your midwife or maternity unit immediately if:
------------------------------------------------------------------

*   your baby is moving less than usual
*   you cannot feel your baby moving anymore
*   there is a change to your baby's usual pattern of movements

They'll need to check your baby's movements and heartbeat.

Do not wait until the next day – call immediately, even if it's the middle of the night.

How often should your baby move?
--------------------------------

There's no set number of movements you should feel each day – every baby is different.

You do not need to count the number of kicks or movements you feel each day.

The important thing is to get to know your baby's usual pattern of movements from day to day.

### Important

Do not use a home doppler (heartbeat listening kit) to try to check the baby's heartbeat yourself. This is not a reliable way to check your baby's health. Even if you hear a heartbeat, this does not mean your baby is well.

Why your baby's movements are important
---------------------------------------

If your baby is not well, they may be less active than usual. Less movement can be a sign of a problem.

The sooner this is found out the better, so you and your baby can be given the right treatment and care.

This could save your baby's life.

Published Time: 2 Dec 2020, 11:29 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Stillbirth is when a baby dies before she or he is born, after 24 weeks of pregnancy. In England, around 1 in 250 births is a stillbirth.

Not all the causes of stillbirth are currently known and it's not possible to prevent every stillbirth.

But we do know that certain factors increase the risk, and there are simple things you can do to reduce these risks.

Go to all your antenatal appointments and scans
-----------------------------------------------

It's important not to miss any of your antenatal appointments or scans. Some of the tests and measurements that can identify potential problems have to be done at specific times.

Going to all your appointments will also mean your midwife can give you relevant information as your pregnancy progresses.

[Find out about antenatal appointments](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/your-antenatal-appointments/)

Eat healthily and keep active
-----------------------------

Try to swap unhealthy foods for healthier options, and try to keep active. Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of problems in pregnancy.

Pregnancy is not the time for a weight loss diet, but you do not need to put on any extra kilos in pregnancy if you're already overweight.

Read about:

*   [how to have a healthy diet in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/have-a-healthy-diet/), including healthy snacks
*   [exercise in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/exercise/)

Stop smoking
------------

If you smoke, the best thing you can do is to stop. Stopping at any time in pregnancy will help, though the sooner the better.

The NHS offers lots of support to help women stop smoking in pregnancy – your midwife, GP or pharmacist can advise you. There will be a stop smoking programme you can join.

Passive smoking (breathing in smoke from other people's cigarettes) is also harmful in pregnancy, so avoid being around people who are smoking if you can.

If your partner or someone else in your household smokes, they can contact NHS stop smoking services for support in quitting.

[Find out about stopping smoking in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/stop-smoking/)

Avoid alcohol in pregnancy
--------------------------

The safest way to ensure your baby is not damaged by alcohol is not to drink while you're pregnant.

If you're finding it hard to stop drinking, ask for help from your midwife or GP.

[Find out about alcohol and pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/drinking-alcohol-while-pregnant/)

Go to sleep on your side
------------------------

Research suggests that going to sleep on your back after 28 weeks of pregnancy doubles the risk of stillbirth.

It's thought this may be to do with the flow of blood and oxygen to the baby.

The safest option is to fall asleep on your side, either left or right. Do not worry if you wake up on your back, just turn on to your side to go back to sleep.

[Find out about sleep position in pregnancy on the Tommy's website](https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/im-pregnant/sleep-side/sleep-position-pregnancy-qa)

Tell your midwife about any drug use
------------------------------------

Using illegal drugs during pregnancy could harm your baby. If you use or have used illegal drugs (such as cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy or heroin) or other substances, tell your midwife or doctor.

The more your midwife knows about your general health, the better she or he will be able to help you and your baby.

Do not be afraid to share this information. It'll be treated in confidence and only shared with other relevant professionals if the midwife thinks it's in the best interests of you and your baby.

[Find out about illegal drugs and pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/illegal-drugs/)

Have the flu jab
----------------

Make sure you have the seasonal flu vaccination, which is available from early autumn each year.

Pregnant women are more at risk from flu complications, such as bronchitis and pneumonia, than the general population. These complications can harm your baby.

Your midwife or GP will offer you the flu jab – it's free and safe to have at any stage of pregnancy.

Women who have had the vaccine in pregnancy also pass some protection on to their babies, which lasts for the first few months of the baby's life.

[Find out about the flu jab in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/flu-jab/)

Avoid people who are ill
------------------------

Wherever possible, avoid contact with people who have signs of infectious illnesses, including diarrhoea, high temperature and being sick (vomiting).

You should also avoid children (as well as adults) who have been diagnosed with "childhood illnesses" (infections most common in childhood) like chickenpox, measles, or parvovirus (slapped cheek syndrome).

If you have been or are in contact with someone with an infection, speak to your midwife or GP for advice.

[Find out about infections in pregnancy that may affect your baby](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/infections-that-may-affect-your-baby/)

Wash your hands
---------------

Be strict about good hygiene wherever you are. This includes washing your hands to reduce the risk of infection, particularly:

*   before preparing food
*   after going to the toilet
*   after changing a nappy, if you already have children

Prepare and store food safely
-----------------------------

It's important to prepare and store food safely to reduce the risk of infection.

*   Wash fruit, vegetables and salads to remove all traces of soil, which may contain toxoplasma (a parasite that can cause [toxoplasmosis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxoplasmosis/)) which can harm your unborn baby.
*   Wash all surfaces and utensils, and your hands, after preparing raw foods (meat, eggs, fish, shellfish and raw vegetables) to help you avoid food poisoning.
*   Make sure that raw foods are stored separately from ready-to-eat foods, otherwise there's a risk of contamination.
*   Use a separate knife and chopping board for raw meats.
*   Heat ready meals until they're steaming hot all the way through – this is especially important for meals containing poultry.
*   Check the use-by date to make sure food is safe to eat – do not eat food after the use-by date even if it looks and smells OK.

You also need to make sure that some foods, such as eggs, poultry, burgers, sausages and whole cuts of meat like lamb, beef, chicken, and pork, are cooked very thoroughly until steaming all the way through.

Avoid some foods in pregnancy
-----------------------------

You should avoid some foods in pregnancy, as they have a higher risk of making you ill with infections such as listeria and salmonella. This includes raw or undercooked meat, some cheeses, and unpasteurised milk.

You should also avoid caffeine or limit it to no more than 200mg a day. Caffeine is in foods and drinks such as coffee, tea, energy drinks, cola and chocolate.

Get to know which [foods to avoid while you're pregnant](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/foods-to-avoid/).

When to get medical help
------------------------

### Urgent advice: Contact your maternity unit or call 111 immediately if:

*   your baby's movements have reduced, changed or stopped
*   you have bleeding from your vagina
*   you have stomach (abdominal) pain
*   you have unusual vaginal discharge or fluid
*   you have swelling, blurred vision or severe headache
*   you have itching anywhere on your body, possibly worse at night

### Your baby's movements have reduced

Call your midwife or maternity unit straight away if:

*   your baby is moving less than usual
*   you cannot feel your baby moving anymore
*   there is a change to your baby's usual pattern of movements

They'll need to check your baby's movements and heartbeat.

Do not wait until the next day, or your next appointment or after the weekend – call your midwife straightaway, even if it's the middle of the night.

Do not use a home monitoring kit (such as a doppler) to try to check the baby's heartbeat yourself.

This is not a reliable way to check your baby's health. Even if you hear a heartbeat, this does not mean your baby is well.

[Find out more about baby movements in pregnancy on the Tommy's website](https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/pregnancy-symptom-checker/baby-fetal-movements)

### You bleed from your vagina

Vaginal bleeding may indicate a problem – read about [bleeding from your vagina in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/pregnancy/what-causes-bleeding-during-pregnancy/).

### You have vaginal discharge that is not normal for you

If you have watery, clear or coloured discharge or fluid from your vagina that seems abnormal for you, contact your maternity unit. This could be your waters breaking or signs of an infection.

[Find out about vaginal discharge in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/vaginal-discharge/)

### You get blurred vision, severe headache or swelling

Blurred vision, severe headache and swelling could be signs of pre-eclampsia. Although pre-eclampsia is often mild, in some pregnancies it can lead to life-threatening problems for both mother and baby.

Symptoms of pre-eclampsia include:

*   sudden swelling – especially of the feet, ankles, hands and face
*   severe headache that does not go away with painkillers
*   vomiting
*   problems with vision, such as blurring or seeing flashing lights
*   severe pain just below the ribs
*   heartburn that does not go away with antacids

[Find out about pre-eclampsia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pre-eclampsia/)

### You have itching, particularly on your hands and feet

Call your maternity unit if you have itching (particularly on the hands and feet, but other areas of the body may also be affected), even if it's mild.

Itching in pregnancy is normal for most women, but it can mean you have a liver disorder called intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP, also called obstetric cholestasis).

If left untreated, ICP can lead to premature labour and increase the risk of stillbirth.

Markdown Content:
**It's recommended that if you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant you should not drink alcohol. This will keep any risk to your baby to a minimum.**

Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, with the more you drink, the greater the risk.

How does alcohol affect my unborn baby?
---------------------------------------

When you drink, alcohol passes from your blood through the placenta to your baby and can seriously affect its development.

Your baby does not have a fully developed liver and cannot process alcohol.

Drinking alcohol during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage, premature birth and your baby having a low birthweight. It can also affect your baby after they're born.

Drinking during pregnancy can cause your baby to develop a serious life-long condition called [fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/fetal-alcohol-spectrum-disorder/).

FASD can cause problems with:

*   learning and behaviour
*   joints, bones, muscles and some organs
*   managing emotions and developing social skills
*   hyperactivity and impulse control
*   communication, such as problems with speech

The risk is likely to be greater the more you drink.

How to avoid alcohol in pregnancy
---------------------------------

It may not be as difficult as you think to avoid alcohol completely during pregnancy. Many women go off the taste of alcohol early in pregnancy.

Most women give up alcohol once they know they're pregnant or when they're planning to become pregnant.

Women who find out they're pregnant after already having drunk in early pregnancy should avoid further drinking for the rest of their pregnancy.

However, they should not worry unnecessarily, as the risks of their baby being affected are likely to be low. If you're concerned, talk to a midwife or doctor.

[Find tips for avoiding alcohol in pregnancy on the Tommy's website](https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/im-pregnant/alcohol-in-pregnancy/tips-alcohol-free-pregnancy)

Getting help to stop drinking alcohol
-------------------------------------

If you have difficulty stopping drinking, talk to a midwife, doctor or pharmacist.

Confidential help and support is also available from a number of different organisations, including:

*   [Drinkaware](https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/) – run a national alcohol helpline; if you're worried about your own or someone else's drinking, call this free helpline on 0300 123 1110 (weekdays 9am to 8pm, weekends 11am to 4pm)
*   [We Are With You](https://www.wearewithyou.org.uk/) – a UK-wide treatment agency that helps individuals, families and communities manage the effects of alcohol and drug misuse
*   [Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)](http://www.alcoholics-anonymous.org.uk/) – a free self-help group; its "12-step" programme involves getting sober with the help of regular support groups

Smoking and your unborn baby
----------------------------

Protecting your baby from tobacco smoke is one of the best things you can do to give your child a healthy start in life. It can be difficult to stop smoking, but it's never too late to quit.

Every cigarette you smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals, many of which are dangerous, so smoking when you are pregnant harms your unborn baby. Cigarettes can restrict the essential oxygen supply to your baby. As a result, their heart must beat harder every time you smoke.

Benefits of stopping smoking in pregnancy
-----------------------------------------

Stopping smoking will help both you and your baby immediately. Harmful gases, such as carbon monoxide, and other damaging chemicals will clear from your body. When you stop smoking:

*   you will reduce the risk of complications in pregnancy and birth
*   you are more likely to have a healthier pregnancy and a healthier baby
*   you will reduce the risk of [stillbirth](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/reducing-the-risk-of-stillbirth/)
*   your baby is less likely to be born too early and have breathing, feeding and health problems that often go with being [premature](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/premature-labour-and-birth/)
*   your baby is less likely to be born with a low birth weight. Babies of smokers are, on average, lighter than other babies, which can cause problems during and after labour. For example, they are more likely to have problems keeping warm and are more likely to get infections
*   you will reduce the risk of [sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-sids/), also known as "cot death"

Stopping smoking now will also help your baby later in life. Children whose parents smoke are more likely to suffer from [asthma](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/asthma/) and other serious illnesses that may need hospital treatment.

The sooner you stop smoking, the better. But even if you stop in the last few weeks of your pregnancy this will benefit you and your baby.

Secondhand (passive) smoke harms your baby
------------------------------------------

If your partner or anyone else who lives with you smokes, their smoke can affect you and your baby before and after their birth. You may also find it more difficult to stop if someone around you smokes.

Secondhand smoke can also reduce your baby's birthweight and increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), also known as "cot death". Babies whose parents smoke are more likely to be admitted to hospital for [bronchitis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bronchitis/) and [pneumonia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pneumonia/) during their first year.

To find out more about quitting and to get support, your partner can call the National Smokefree helpline on [0300 123 1044](tel:03001231044) from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday, and 11am to 4pm Saturday and Sunday.

Nicotine replacement therapy
----------------------------

You can use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) during pregnancy if it will help you stop smoking and you're unable to stop without it. Stop smoking tablets such as varenicline (Champix) or bupropion (Zyban) are not recommended during pregnancy.

NRT contains only nicotine and none of the damaging chemicals found in cigarettes, so it is a much better option than continuing to smoke. It helps you by giving you the nicotine you would have had from a cigarette.

You can be prescribed NRT during pregnancy by a GP or an NHS stop smoking adviser. You can also buy it over the counter without a prescription from a pharmacy.

NRT is available as:

*   patches
*   gum
*   inhalator
*   nasal spray
*   mouth spray
*   oral strips
*   lozenges
*   microtabs

If you have pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting, patches may be a better solution.

NRT patches should be used for no more than 16 hours in any 24-hour period. The best way to remember this is to remove the patch at bedtime.

Before using any of these products, speak to a midwife, GP, a pharmacist or a specialist stop smoking adviser.

By getting this specialist advice you can be sure that you're doing the best for your baby and for you.

Call the National Smokefree helpline on [0300 123 1044](tel:03001231044) from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday, and 11am to 4pm Saturday and Sunday.

Remember, you are twice as likely to be successful at quitting if you get some support from a trained adviser.

### Liquorice-flavoured nicotine products

Pregnant women are advised to avoid liquorice-flavoured nicotine products. Although there is no known risk with small amounts of liquorice flavouring, the manufacturers advise caution.

This caution is based on information about the adverse effects associated with excessive amounts of liquorice root. As other flavours are available, pregnant women are advised to choose an alternative, such as fruit or mint.

Find out more about [stop smoking treatments](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stop-smoking-treatments/).

E-cigarettes in pregnancy
-------------------------

E-cigarettes are fairly new and there are still some things we do not know. However, current evidence on e-cigarettes indicates they are much less risky than smoking.

Cigarettes deliver nicotine along with thousands of harmful chemicals. E-cigarettes allow you to inhale nicotine through a vapour rather than smoke. By itself, nicotine is relatively harmless.

E-cigarettes do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, the 2 main toxins in cigarette smoke. Carbon monoxide is particularly harmful to developing babies. The vapour from an e-cigarette does contain some of the potentially harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke, but at much lower levels.

If using an e-cigarette helps you to stop smoking, it is much safer for you and your baby than continuing to smoke.

Unlike nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), such as patches or gum, e-cigarettes are not available on an NHS prescription. If you want to use an e-cigarette, you can still get free expert help from a stop smoking adviser.

Call the National Smokefree helpline on [0300 123 1044](tel:03001231044) for more information, or ask a midwife to refer you.

[Find out more about using e-cigarettes to stop smoking](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/quit-smoking/using-e-cigarettes-to-stop-smoking/).

National Smokefree helpline
---------------------------

The National Smokefree helpline offers free help, support and advice on stopping smoking and can give you details of local support services.

You can also sign up to receive ongoing advice and support at a time that suits you.

Illegal drugs in pregnancy
==========================

Using illegal or street drugs during pregnancy, including cannabis, ecstasy, cocaine and heroin, could have a serious effect on your unborn baby.

If you regularly use drugs, it's important to tackle this now you're pregnant.

If you regularly use cocaine, heroin, or other similar drugs (opiates or opioids), do not stop or reduce the amount you take without speaking to a doctor first. It’s important to withdraw from these drugs in the right way to reduce the risk of problems for you and your baby.

Getting help
------------

If you use drugs, it's important to seek help straight away so you can get the right advice and support.

You can get help from:

*   your midwife
*   your GP
*   [drug treatment services](https://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Drug%20treatment%20services/LocationSearch/340)

What if I took drugs before I knew I was pregnant?
--------------------------------------------------

If you took a drug without realising you were pregnant on a one-off occasion, try not to worry – it's unlikely to have affected your baby.

But if illegal drugs are part of your life, getting help can really improve the outlook for you and your baby.

Title: Vaccinations in pregnancy

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/vaccinations/

Published Time: 9 Dec 2020, 1:19 p.m.

Markdown Content:
Some vaccines, such as the inactivated seasonal flu vaccine and the whooping cough vaccine, are recommended during pregnancy to protect the health of you and your baby. An inactivated vaccine does not contain a live version of the virus it is protecting against.

Some vaccines, such as the tetanus vaccine, are perfectly safe to have during pregnancy if necessary.

But it does depend on the type of vaccination. For example, the MMR and yellow fever vaccines have potential risks, and you need to discuss these with your midwife or doctor before deciding whether to have the vaccine.

Vaccines recommended in pregnancy
---------------------------------

### Flu vaccine

During pregnancy, your immune system (the body's natural defence) is weakened to protect the pregnancy. This can mean you're less able to fight off infections such as flu.

Pregnant women are more likely to get flu complications (such as pneumonia) than women who are not pregnant, and are more likely to be admitted to hospital. Having the flu vaccine means you're less likely to get flu, or if you do catch flu, it is less likely to be severe.

[Find out more about the flu jab in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/flu-jab/)

### Whooping cough vaccine

Whooping cough can be a very serious infection, and young babies are most at risk. Most babies with whooping cough will be admitted to hospital.

When you have the whooping cough vaccination in pregnancy, your body produces antibodies to protect against whooping cough. These antibodies pass to your baby giving them high levels of protection against serious whooping cough illness until they're able to have their whooping cough vaccination at 8 weeks old.

You usually have the whooping cough vaccine at 20 weeks pregnant, but you can have it from 16 weeks.

To give your baby the best protection against whooping cough, you should have the vaccine before 32 weeks of pregnancy. If for any reason you miss having the vaccine before 32 weeks, you can still have it later.

If you are 20 weeks pregnant and have not been offered the whooping cough vaccine, contact your midwife or GP surgery.

[Find out more about the whooping cough vaccination in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/whooping-cough-vaccination/)

### Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common virus that causes coughs and colds. RSV usually gets better by itself, but it can be serious for babies.

RSV can cause serious lung infections (including [pneumonia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pneumonia/) and [bronchiolitis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bronchiolitis/)), which can make it difficult for babies to breathe and feed. These illnesses may need to be treated in hospital.

When you have the RSV vaccine in pregnancy, the protection from the vaccine is passed to your baby. This means your baby is less likely to get severe RSV for the first 6 months after they're born.

You should be offered the RSV vaccine around the time of your 28-week antenatal appointment. Getting vaccinated as soon as possible from 28 weeks will provide the best protection for your baby. But it can be given later if needed, including up until you go into labour.

Speak to your maternity service or GP surgery if you are 28 weeks pregnant or more and have not been offered the vaccine.

[Find out more about the RSV vaccine](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/rsv-vaccine/)

### COVID-19 vaccine

If you're pregnant, or think you might be, it's recommended you get vaccinated against COVID-19 to protect you and your baby.

You're at higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19 if you're pregnant. If you get COVID-19 late in your pregnancy, your baby could also be at risk.

It's safe to have the vaccine during any stage of pregnancy, from the first few weeks up to your expected due date.

The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain any live viruses and cannot give you or your baby COVID-19.

[Find out more about pregnancy and COVID-19 vaccination](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/pregnancy-breastfeeding-fertility-and-covid-19-vaccination/)

Vaccines not usually advised in pregnancy (live vaccines)
---------------------------------------------------------

If a vaccine uses a live version of the virus, such as the MMR vaccine, you'll usually be advised to wait until after your baby is born before you get vaccinated.

This is because there's a potential risk that live vaccines could cause your unborn baby to become infected. But there's no evidence that any live vaccine causes birth defects.

Sometimes, a live vaccine may be used during pregnancy if the risk of infection is greater than the risk of the vaccination. Your midwife, GP or pharmacist can give you more advice about vaccinations during pregnancy.

Live vaccines include:

*   BCG (vaccination against tuberculosis)
*   MMR (measles, mumps and rubella)
*   oral polio (which forms part of the 6-in-1 vaccine given to infants)
*   oral typhoid
*   yellow fever

Travel vaccines in pregnancy
----------------------------

When you're pregnant, it's best to avoid visiting countries or areas where travel vaccinations are required.

[See the TravelHealthPro website for information and advice about travel vaccinations for different countries](http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/countries)

It may not always be possible to avoid areas that require vaccinations when you're pregnant. If this is the case, talk to a midwife or GP, who can tell you about the risks and benefits of any vaccinations you might need.

If there's a high risk of infection in the area you are travelling to, it's often safer to have a vaccine rather than travel unprotected as most diseases will be more harmful to your baby than a vaccine.

For example, yellow fever is a virus spread by mosquitoes. Most people who get severe yellow fever die from it. The yellow fever vaccine is a live vaccine, but it may be considered necessary to have the vaccination if you're travelling to areas where yellow fever is common because the risks of yellow fever are so high.

Pregnancy and malaria
---------------------

Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to malaria. This is a serious condition which, if severe, can be fatal for both a mother and her baby. Malaria mainly affects countries in:

*   Africa
*   South America and Central America 
*   Asia
*   the Middle East

If possible, avoid travelling in these areas if you are pregnant. However, if you're unable to postpone or cancel your trip, preventative treatment is available. This involves taking antimalarial medicine tablets to reduce your risk of getting malaria.

The antimalarial medicine you take may depend on which country you're travelling to, your stage of pregnancy and whether you have any other pre-existing medical conditions. In some areas certain antimalarial medicines do not work because the malaria parasite has developed resistance to them.

Some antimalarial medicines are known to affect the developing baby. For example, doxycycline can cause the baby's milk teeth to be discoloured if a pregnant woman takes it after the first 12 or 13 weeks of pregnancy.

Other antimalarial medicines have not been studied sufficiently and more research on their use in pregnancy is needed. But the risk of harm to you and your baby from malaria is likely to be much greater than any potential risk from taking antimalarial medicine.

[See the bumps website for more information about malaria and antimalarial medicines and their use in pregnancy](http://www.medicinesinpregnancy.org/Medicine--pregnancy/Malaria/)

*   [bumps: mefloquine](http://www.medicinesinpregnancy.org/Medicine--pregnancy/Mefloquine/)
*   [bumps: proguanil](http://www.medicinesinpregnancy.org/Medicine--pregnancy/Proguanil/)

### Protecting yourself against malaria

If you're pregnant, make sure you take precautions against being bitten by insects. For example:

*   use a mosquito repellent that's specifically recommended for use in pregnancy 
*   wear a long-sleeved top, full-length trousers and socks to cover up your skin from dusk until dawn 
*   always sleep under a mosquito net

Title: The flu jab in pregnancy

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/flu-jab/

Published Time: 3 Dec 2020, 12:13 a.m.

Markdown Content:
It's recommended that all pregnant women have the flu vaccine, whatever stage of pregnancy they're at. It's free for pregnant women.

Why are pregnant women advised to have the flu vaccine?
-------------------------------------------------------

A flu jab will help protect both you and your baby.

Pregnancy changes how the body responds to infections such as [flu](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/flu/). There is good evidence that pregnant women have a higher chance of developing complications if they get flu, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy.

Young babies also have a higher risk of getting seriously ill if they get flu. Having flu increases the chances of pregnant women and their babies needing intensive care.

One of the most common complications of flu is [bronchitis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bronchitis/), a chest infection that can become serious and develop into [pneumonia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pneumonia/).

If you have flu while you're pregnant, it could cause your baby to be born prematurely or have a low birthweight, and may even lead to [stillbirth](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stillbirth/) or death.

Is the flu vaccine safe in pregnancy?
-------------------------------------

Yes. Studies have shown that it's safe to have a flu vaccine during any stage of pregnancy, from the first few weeks up until you go into labour.

Women who have had a flu vaccine while pregnant also pass some protection on to their babies. This lasts for the first few months after they're born, when they're particularly at risk from flu.

It's safe to breastfeed if you had the flu vaccine while pregnant.

If you're already breastfeeding, you can have the flu vaccine if you're eligible (for example, because of a long-term health condition).

When should I have the flu jab?
-------------------------------

You can get the flu vaccine from September. It's best to get vaccinated as soon as you can, especially if you're near to your due date. Getting vaccinated will help protect your baby in the first few months after they're born.

If you were not vaccinated in the autumn, you can be vaccinated later in the winter although it's better to get it earlier.

Do not worry if you find that you're pregnant later in the flu season – you can have the vaccine then if you have not already had it.

If you miss having the flu vaccine for any reason, you can still have it up until you go into labour.

How do I get the flu vaccine?
-----------------------------

To get a flu vaccine, you can:

*   [book a flu vaccination appointment at a pharmacy online](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/pharmacies/book-flu-vaccination/) or in the [NHS App](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/) (if you're aged 18 or over)
*   [find a pharmacy that offers NHS flu vaccination](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/pharmacies/find-a-pharmacy-that-offers-free-flu-vaccination/) (if you're aged 18 or over)
*   contact your GP surgery to book an appointment

Some people may be able to get vaccinated through their maternity service.

If I had the flu jab last year, do I need to have it again now?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, because the viruses that cause flu change every year. This means the types of flu virus the vaccines are designed to prevent this year may be different from last year. The protection from a flu vaccine also goes down with time.

If you had the flu vaccine during the last flu season because you were pregnant (same pregnancy or a previous pregnancy), or because you're in a vulnerable group, you need to have it again this year.

Will the flu jab give me flu?
-----------------------------

No. Injected flu vaccines do not contain any live viruses, and cannot cause flu. Some people get a slightly raised temperature and aching muscles for a couple of days afterwards, and you may feel sore at the injection site.

Can I have the flu jab at the same time as other vaccines?
----------------------------------------------------------

You can have a flu vaccine at the same time as other pregnancy vaccinations, but it's best to have them as soon as they're offered rather than waiting to have them at the same time.

You should have your:

*   flu vaccine as soon as possible when it becomes available (usually from September)
*   [whooping cough vaccine](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/whooping-cough-vaccination/) at around 20 weeks pregnant
*   [RSV vaccine](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/rsv-vaccine/) from 28 weeks pregnant

Do not delay getting any of your vaccinations so you can have them at the same time.

I'm pregnant and think I have flu. What should I do?
----------------------------------------------------

Talk to a GP or midwife as soon as possible. If you do have flu, there's a prescribed medicine you can take that might help, or reduce your risk of complications, but it needs to be taken very soon after symptoms appear.

Title: Whooping cough vaccination in pregnancy

URL Source: https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/whooping-cough-vaccination/

Published Time: 3 Dec 2020, 12:16 a.m.

Markdown Content:
Whooping cough (pertussis) rates have risen recently. Babies who are too young to start their vaccinations are at greatest risk.

Whooping cough can be serious for babies and may lead to complications resulting in hospitalisation and even death.

Pregnant women can help protect their babies by getting vaccinated.

You should usually have the whooping cough vaccine around the time of your mid-pregnancy scan (usually at 20 weeks pregnant), but you can have it from 16 weeks.

To help give the best protection to your baby, you should have the vaccine before 32 weeks. If you miss out, you can still have the vaccine later.

Why are pregnant women advised to have the whooping cough vaccine?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting vaccinated while you're pregnant is highly effective in protecting your baby from developing whooping cough in the first few weeks of their life.

The immunity you get from the vaccine will pass to your baby through the placenta and provide passive protection for them until they are old enough to be routinely vaccinated against whooping cough at 8 weeks old.

When should I have the whooping cough vaccine?
----------------------------------------------

You usually have the whooping cough vaccine at 20 weeks pregnant, but you can have it from 16 weeks.

If you are 20 weeks pregnant and have not been offered the whooping cough vaccine, contact your midwife or GP surgery.

To give your baby the best protection against whooping cough, you should have the vaccine before 32 weeks of pregnancy. This maximises the chance that your baby will be protected from birth, through the transfer of your antibodies before they are born.

If for any reason you miss having the vaccine before 32 weeks, you can have it later, even after you give birth. However, this is not ideal, as your baby is less likely to get protection from you. At this stage, having the vaccination may not directly protect your baby, but would help protect you from whooping cough and from passing it on to your baby.

Is the whooping cough vaccine safe in pregnancy?
------------------------------------------------

There's no evidence to suggest that the whooping cough vaccine is unsafe for you or your unborn baby.

Pertussis-containing vaccine (whooping cough vaccine) has been used routinely in pregnant women in the UK since October 2012. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) carefully monitors the ongoing safety of all medicines.

The [MHRA's study of around 20,000 vaccinated women published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ)](http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g4219) found no evidence of risks to pregnancy or babies.

A number of other countries, including the US, Argentina, Belgium, Spain, Australia and New Zealand, recommend vaccination against whooping cough in pregnancy.

Read more about [why vaccinations are important and the safest way to protect you and your baby](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/why-vaccination-is-important-and-the-safest-way-to-protect-yourself/).

Is whooping cough vaccination in pregnancy working?
---------------------------------------------------

Yes, it is. Published research from the UK vaccination programme shows that vaccinating pregnant women against whooping cough has been highly effective in protecting young babies until they can have their first vaccination when they are 8 weeks old.

An additional benefit is that the protection the mother receives from the vaccination will lower her own risk of infection and of passing whooping cough on to her baby.

Which whooping cough vaccine will I be given?
---------------------------------------------

There is no whooping cough-only vaccine. You'll be offered a vaccine that also protects against other illnesses.

You'll usually be offered a vaccine called ADACEL that protects against whooping cough, diphtheria and tetanus.

If the ADACEL vaccine is not available or suitable for you, you'll be offered a vaccine called Boostrix IPV that protects against whooping cough, diphtheria, tetanus and polio.

Find out more about the ADACEL and Boostrix IPV vaccines:

*   [Boostrix IPV 4-in-1 vaccine patient leaflet (Electronic Medicines Compendium website; PDF only, 150KB)](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/files/pil.5302.pdf)

What are the side effects of the whooping cough vaccine?
--------------------------------------------------------

After having the whooping cough vaccine, you may have some mild side effects such as swelling, redness or tenderness where the vaccine is injected in your upper arm. This is normal after having a vaccine and it should only last a few days.

Other side effects can include a high temperature, irritation at the injection site, nausea and loss of appetite, tiredness and headache. Serious side effects are extremely rare.

What is whooping cough?
-----------------------

Whooping cough (medically known as pertussis) is a serious infection that causes long bouts of coughing and choking, making it hard to breathe. The "whoop" is caused by gasping for breath after each bout of coughing, though babies do not always make this noise.

Read more about [whooping cough](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/whooping-cough/).

Should I be concerned about whooping cough?
-------------------------------------------

Whooping cough is a highly infectious, serious illness that can lead to [pneumonia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pneumonia/) and brain damage, particularly in young babies. Most babies with whooping cough will need hospital treatment, and when whooping cough is very severe they may die.

Research from the vaccination programme in England shows that vaccinating pregnant women against whooping cough has been highly effective in protecting young babies until they can receive their own vaccinations from 8 weeks of age.

Babies can be infected by people with whooping cough in these older age groups, so it is still important for pregnant women to be vaccinated to protect their babies.

Are babies not vaccinated against whooping cough to protect them?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, usually at 8 weeks old, but the babies that have been getting whooping cough are generally too young to have started their normal vaccinations, so they are not yet protected against the illness.

How can I protect my baby against whooping cough?
-------------------------------------------------

The only way you can help protect your baby from getting whooping cough in their first few weeks after birth is by having the whooping cough vaccination yourself while you are pregnant (before 32 weeks for the best protection).

After vaccination, your body produces antibodies to protect against whooping cough. You will then pass some immunity to your unborn baby.

Will the whooping cough vaccine in pregnancy give me whooping cough?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

No. The whooping cough vaccine is not a "live" vaccine. This means it does not contain whooping cough (or polio, diphtheria or tetanus), and cannot cause whooping cough in you, or in your baby.

Will my baby still need to be vaccinated against whooping cough at 8 weeks if I've had the vaccine while pregnant?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Whenever you have the whooping cough vaccine, your baby will still need to be vaccinated according to the normal [NHS vaccination schedule](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/nhs-vaccinations-and-when-to-have-them/) when they reach 8 weeks old. Babies are protected against whooping cough by the [6-in-1 vaccine](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/6-in-1-vaccine/).

Can I have the whooping cough vaccine at the same time as the flu jab?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can have the whooping cough vaccine when you get the flu vaccine, but do not delay either vaccine so that you can have both at the same time.

How can I get the whooping cough vaccination?
---------------------------------------------

The vaccine is available from your GP, though some antenatal clinics may also offer it.

You're usually offered the vaccination around the time of your mid-pregnancy scan at 20 weeks pregnant, but you can have it from 16 weeks of your pregnancy. You may be offered the vaccination at a routine antenatal appointment.

If you are 20 weeks pregnant and have not been offered the vaccine, talk to your midwife or GP and make an appointment to get vaccinated.

I was vaccinated against whooping cough as a child, do I need to get vaccinated again?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, because any protection you may have had through either having whooping cough or being vaccinated when you were young is likely to have worn off and will not provide sufficient protection for your baby.

I was vaccinated against whooping cough in a previous pregnancy, do I need to be vaccinated again?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you should get re-vaccinated at 20 weeks in each pregnancy to maximise protection for your baby.

How do I spot whooping cough in my baby?
----------------------------------------

Be alert to the [signs and symptoms of whooping cough](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/whooping-cough/), which include severe coughing fits that may be accompanied by difficulty breathing (or pauses in breathing in young infants) or vomiting after coughing, and the characteristic "whoop" sound. Young babies might not make the "whoop" sound.

If you are worried your baby may have whooping cough, contact your doctor immediately.

Published Time: 3 Dec 2020, 12:24 a.m.

Markdown Content:
Throughout life, we all encounter many viruses and bacteria.

This page is about infections that can cause problems in pregnancy, their symptoms and what to do if you're worried.

Chickenpox in pregnancy
-----------------------

[Chickenpox](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chickenpox/) infection in pregnancy can be dangerous for both you and your baby, so it's important to seek advice early if you think you may have chickenpox.

Most adults in the UK are immune to chickenpox infection. But if you've never had chickenpox (or you're unsure if you've had it) and you come into contact with a child or adult who does, speak to your GP, obstetrician or midwife immediately. A blood test will find out if you're immune.

CMV in pregnancy
----------------

CMV (cytomegalovirus) is a common virus that's part of the herpes group, which can also cause cold sores and chickenpox. CMV infections are common in young children.

Infection can be dangerous during pregnancy as it can cause problems for unborn babies, such as hearing loss, visual impairment or blindness, learning difficulties and epilepsy.

CMV is particularly dangerous to your baby if you have not had the infection before.

It's not always possible to prevent a CMV infection, but you can reduce the risk by:

*   washing your hands regularly with soap and hot water, particularly if you have been changing nappies, or work in a nursery or daycare centre
*   not kissing young children on the face – it's better to kiss them on the head or give them a hug
*   not sharing food or cutlery with young children, and not drinking from the same glass as them

This is particularly important if you have a job that brings you into close contact with young children.

[Find out more about cytomegalovirus](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cytomegalovirus-cmv/)

Group B streptococcus in pregnancy
----------------------------------

[Group B streptococcus (GBS, or group B strep)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/group-b-strep/) rarely causes harm or symptoms.

It causes no problem in most pregnancies but, in a small number, group B strep infects the baby, usually just before or during labour, leading to serious illness.

If you've already had a baby who had a group B strep infection, you should be offered antibiotics during labour to reduce the chances of your new baby getting the infection. You should also be offered them during labour if you've had a group B strep urinary tract infection during the pregnancy.

Group B strep infection of the baby is more likely if:

*   you go into [premature labour](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/labour-and-birth/signs-of-labour/premature-labour-and-birth/) (before 37 weeks of pregnancy)
*   labour does not start within 24 hours after your waters break
*   you have a high temperature during labour
*   you currently carry group B strep

Your midwife or doctor will assess whether you should be offered antibiotics during labour to protect your baby from being infected.

It's possible to be tested for group B strep late in pregnancy. Talk to your doctor or midwife if you have concerns.

---------------------------------

### Cats

Cat faeces may contain toxoplasma – an organism that causes [toxoplasmosis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxoplasmosis/). Toxoplasmosis can harm your baby.

To reduce the risk of infection:

*   avoid emptying cat litter trays while you're pregnant
*   if nobody else can empty the litter tray, use disposable rubber gloves – trays should be cleaned daily
*   avoid close contact with sick cats
*   even if you do not have a cat, wear gloves if gardening in case the soil is contaminated with faeces
*   wash your hands and gloves after gardening
*   if you do come into contact with cat faeces, wash your hands thoroughly
*   follow general food hygiene rules – [find out more about food hygiene from the Food Standards Agency website](https://www.food.gov.uk/consumer-advice/food-hygiene)

### Sheep

Lambs and sheep can carry toxoplasma, which causes toxoplasmosis.

Avoid lambing or milking ewes, as well as all contact with newborn lambs. Tell your doctor if you experience flu-like symptoms after coming into contact with sheep.

### Pigs

Research is ongoing to see if pigs can be a source of hepatitis E infection. This infection is dangerous if you're pregnant.

Prevent infections by:

*   avoiding close contact with pigs
*   cooking pork and pork products thoroughly
*   washing your hands thoroughly after touching animals and before preparing, serving and eating food

Hepatitis B
-----------

[Hepatitis B](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hepatitis-b/) is a virus that infects the liver. Many people with hepatitis B will show no sign of illness, but they can be carriers and may infect others.

The virus is spread by having sex with an infected person without using a condom, and by direct contact with infected blood. If you have hepatitis B or are infected during pregnancy, you can pass the infection on to your baby at birth.

You'll be offered a blood test for hepatitis B as part of your antenatal care. Babies who are at risk should be given the hepatitis B vaccine at birth and then again at 4 weeks and 12 months, in addition to their routine vaccinations, to prevent infection and serious liver disease later on in life.

Hepatitis C
-----------

The [hepatitis C virus](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hepatitis-c/) infects the liver. Many people with hepatitis C have no symptoms and are unaware they are infected. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with infected blood.

In people who take illegal drugs, this can be a result of sharing blood-contaminated needles.

People who received a blood transfusion in the UK prior to September 1991, or blood products prior to 1986, may also be at risk.

Hepatitis C can also be transmitted by receiving medical or dental treatment in countries where hepatitis C is common and infection control may be poor, or by having sex with an infected partner.

If you have hepatitis C, you may pass the infection on to your baby, although the risk is much lower than with hepatitis B or HIV. This cannot currently be prevented.

Your baby can be tested for hepatitis C and, if they're infected, they can be referred for specialist assessment.

Herpes in pregnancy
-------------------

[Genital herpes](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/genital-herpes/) infection can be dangerous for a newborn baby.

You can get herpes through genital contact with an infected person or from oral sex with someone who has cold sores (oral herpes).

Initial infection causes painful blisters or ulcers on the genitals. Less severe outbreaks usually occur for some years afterwards.

Treatment is available if your first infection occurs in pregnancy. If your first infection occurs near the end of pregnancy or during labour, a [caesarean section](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/caesarean-section/) may be recommended to reduce the risk of passing herpes on to your baby.

If you or your partner have herpes, use condoms or avoid sex during an outbreak. Avoid unprotected oral sex as herpes is very easy to pass on.

Tell your midwife or doctor if either you or your partner have recurring herpes or develop sores.

HIV in pregnancy
----------------

You'll be offered a confidential [HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids/) test as part of your routine antenatal care. Your midwife or doctor will discuss the test with you, and counselling will be available if the result is positive.

[Read more about screening for HIV in pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/screening-for-hepatitis-b-hiv-and-syphilis/)

Current evidence suggests that if you're HIV positive, in good health and without symptoms of the infection you're unlikely to be adversely affected by pregnancy.

However, HIV can be passed to your baby during pregnancy, birth, breastfeeding or chestfeeding.

If you're diagnosed with HIV, you and your doctor will need to discuss the management of your pregnancy and birth to reduce the risk of infection for your baby.

Treatment in pregnancy greatly reduces the risk of passing on HIV to the baby – from 1 in 4 to fewer than 1 in 300. Your baby will be tested for HIV at birth and at regular intervals for up to 2 years. They'll be given medicine for 2 to 4 weeks after they're born to reduce the chance of them getting HIV.

If you have HIV, the safest way to feed your baby is with formula milk. This is because HIV can be passed to a baby through breastmilk.

It can be possible to breastfeed it you’re taking antiretroviral medicine and your HIV viral load is undetectable (very low).

Your doctor or midwife can discuss breastfeeding with you.

If you're HIV positive, talk to your doctor or midwife about your own health and the options open to you. There are also organisations you can contact for information and support, including:

*   [Positively UK](http://www.positivelyuk.org/)
*   the [Terrence Higgins Trust](http://www.tht.org.uk/)

Slapped cheek syndrome in pregnancy
-----------------------------------

[Slapped cheek syndrome](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/slapped-cheek-syndrome/) is common in children. It typically causes a rash on the face.

Slapped cheek syndrome is highly infectious and can be harmful to the baby.

If you come into contact with anyone who is infected, you should talk to your doctor, who can carry out a blood test to check whether you're immune. In most cases, the baby is not affected if you have slapped cheek syndrome.

Rubella (german measles) in pregnancy
-------------------------------------

[Rubella](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/rubella/) is uncommon in the UK thanks to the high uptake of [MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/mmr-vaccine/).

But if you develop rubella in the first 4 months of pregnancy, it can lead to serious problems, including birth defects and miscarriage.

If you're pregnant, you should contact your GP or midwife as soon as possible if:

*   you come into contact with someone who has rubella
*   you have a rash or come into contact with anyone who does
*   you have symptoms of rubella

It's unlikely you have rubella in these circumstances, but you may need a blood test to check.

If you're pregnant and are not sure whether you've had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, ask your GP practice to check your vaccination history.

If you have not had both doses or there's no record, you should ask for the vaccine when you go for your 6-week postnatal check after the birth. This will protect you in any future pregnancies.

The MMR vaccine cannot be given during pregnancy.

STIs in pregnancy
-----------------

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) often have no symptoms, so you may not know if you have one. However, many STIs can affect your baby's health both during pregnancy and after the birth.

If you have any reason to believe you or your partner may have an STI, go for a check-up as soon as possible. You can ask your GP or midwife. If you prefer, you can go to a sexual health clinic. Confidentiality is guaranteed.

Zika virus
----------

The [Zika virus](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/zika/) can cause birth defects if you catch it while pregnant. In particular, it can cause the baby to have an abnormally small head (microcephaly).

Zika does not naturally occur in the UK. Seek travel health advice before your trip if you plan to go to an affected area, such as:

*   South or Central America
*   the Caribbean
*   the Pacific islands
*   Africa
*   Asia

While pregnant, it's recommended that you postpone non-essential travel to high-risk areas.

[Get information on the country-specific risk on the TravelHealthPro website](https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/countries)

It is also recommended that you avoid getting pregnant while travelling and for 3 months after returning to the UK.

Zika is spread by mosquitoes, or by having sex with someone who's infected. You can reduce your risk of mosquito bites by using insect repellent containing DEET and wearing loose clothing that covers your arms and legs.
